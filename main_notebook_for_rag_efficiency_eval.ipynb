Its name came from its ability to outdistance other horse breeds in races of a quarter mile or less ; some have been clocked at speeds up to 55 mph ( 88.5 km / h ) . The American Quarter Horse is the most popular breed in the United States today , and the American Quarter Horse Association is the largest breed registry in the world , with almost 3 million living American Quarter Horses registered in 2014 . The American Quarter Horse is well known both as a race horse and for its performance in rodeos , horse shows and as a working ranch horse . The compact body of the American Quarter Horse is well - suited to the intricate and speedy maneuvers required in reining , cutting , working cow horse , barrel racing , calf roping , and other western riding events , especially those involving live cattle . The American Quarter Horse is also shown in English disciplines , driving , and many other equestrian activities . Contents ( hide ) 1 Breed History 1.1 Colonial era 1.2 Westward expansion 1.3 Development as a distinct breed 2 `` Appendix '' and `` Foundation '' horses 3 American Quarter Horses today 4 Breed characteristics 4.1 Stock type 4.2 Halter type 4.3 Racing and hunter type 5 Genetic diseases 6 See also 7 References 8 Sources 9 Further reading 10 External links Breed history ( edit ) Colonial era ( edit ) In the 17th century , colonists on the eastern seaboard of what today is the United States began to cross imported English Thoroughbred horses with assorted `` native '' horses such as the Chickasaw horse , which was a breed developed by Native American people from horses descended from Spain , developed from Iberian , Arabian and Barb stock brought to what is now the Southeastern United States by the Conquistadors . One of the most famous of these early imports was Janus , a Thoroughbred who was the grandson of the Godolphin Arabian . He was foaled in 1746 , and imported to colonial Virginia in 1756 . The influence of Thoroughbreds like Janus contributed genes crucial to the development of the colonial `` Quarter Horse '' . The breed is sometimes referred to as the `` Famous American Quarter Running Horse '' . The resulting horse was small , hardy , and quick , and was used as a work horse during the week and a race horse on the weekends . As flat racing became popular with the colonists , the Quarter Horse gained even more popularity as a sprinter over courses that , by necessity , were shorter than the classic racecourses of England , and were often no more than a straight stretch of road or flat piece of open land . When matched against a Thoroughbred , local sprinters often won . As the Thoroughbred breed became established in America , many colonial Quarter Horses were included in the original American stud books , starting a long association between the Thoroughbred breed and what would later become officially known as the `` Quarter Horse '' , named after the ⁄ mile ( 0.40 km ) race distance at which it excelled . with some individuals being clocked at up to 55 mph . Westward expansion ( edit ) In the 19th century , pioneers heading West needed a hardy , willing horse . On the Great Plains , settlers encountered horses that descended from the Spanish stock Hernán Cortés and other Conquistadors had introduced into the viceroyalty of New Spain , which today includes the Southwestern United States and Mexico . These horses of the west included herds of feral animals known as Mustangs , as well as horses domesticated by Native Americans , including the Comanche , Shoshoni and Nez Perce tribes . As the colonial Quarter Horse was crossed with these western horses , the pioneers found that the new crossbred had innate `` cow sense '' , a natural instinct for working with cattle , making it popular with cattlemen on ranches . Development as a distinct breed ( edit ) See also : American Quarter Horse Association and American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame A photograph of Peter McCue , taken in Oklahoma around 1905 . Early foundation sires of Quarter horse type included Steel Dust , foaled 1843 ; Shiloh ( or Old Shiloh ) , foaled 1844 ; Old Cold Deck ( 1862 ) ; Lock 's Rondo , one of many `` Rondo '' horses , foaled in 1880 ; Old Billy -- again , one of many `` Billy '' horses -- foaled circa 1880 ; Traveler , a stallion of unknown breeding , known to have been in Texas by 1889 ; and Peter McCue , foaled 1895 , registered as a Thoroughbred but of disputed pedigree . The main duty of the ranch horse in the American West was working cattle . Even after the invention of the automobile , horses were still irreplaceable for handling livestock on the range . Thus , major Texas cattle ranches , such as the King Ranch , the 6666 ( Four Sixes ) Ranch , and the Waggoner Ranch played a significant role in the development of the modern Quarter Horse . The skills needed by cowboys and their horses became the foundation of the rodeo , a contest which began with informal competition between cowboys and expanded to become a major competitive event throughout the west . To this day , the Quarter Horse dominates the sport both in speed events and in competition that emphasizes the handling of live cattle . However , sprint races were also popular weekend entertainment and racing became a source of economic gain for breeders as well . As a result , more Thoroughbred blood was added back into the developing American Quarter Horse breed . The American Quarter Horse also benefitted from the addition of Arabian , Morgan , and even Standardbred bloodlines . In 1940 , the American Quarter Horse Association ( AQHA ) was formed by a group of horsemen and ranchers from the southwestern United States dedicated to preserving the pedigrees of their ranch horses . The horse honored with the first registration number , P - 1 , was Wimpy , a descendant of the King Ranch foundation sire Old Sorrel . Other sires alive at the founding of the AQHA were given the earliest registration numbers Joe Reed P - 3 , Chief P - 5 , Oklahoma Star P - 6 , Cowboy P - 12 , and Waggoner 's Rainy Day P - 13 . The Thoroughbred race horse Three Bars , alive in the early years of the AQHA , is recognized by the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame as one of the significant foundation sires for the Quarter Horse breed . Other significant Thoroughbred sires seen in early AQHA pedigrees include Rocket Bar , Top Deck and Depth Charge . `` Appendix '' and `` Foundation '' Horses ( edit ) Since the American Quarter Horse formally established itself as a breed , the AQHA stud book has remained open to additional Thoroughbred blood via a performance standard . An `` Appendix '' American Quarter Horse is a first generation cross between a registered Thoroughbred and an American Quarter Horse or a cross between a `` numbered '' American Quarter Horse and an `` appendix '' American Quarter Horse . The resulting offspring is registered in the `` appendix '' of the American Quarter Horse Association 's studbook , hence the nickname . Horses listed in the appendix may be entered in competition , but offspring are not initially eligible for full AQHA registration . If the Appendix horse meets certain conformational criteria and is shown or raced successfully in sanctioned AQHA events , the horse can earn its way from the appendix into the permanent studbook , making its offspring eligible for AQHA registration . Since Quarter Horse / Thoroughbred crosses continue to enter the official registry of the American Quarter Horse breed , this creates a continual gene flow from the Thoroughbred breed into the American Quarter Horse breed , which has altered many of the characteristics that typified the breed in the early years of its formation . Some breeders , who argue that the continued infusion of Thoroughbred bloodlines is beginning to compromise the integrity of the breed standard , favor the earlier style of horse and have created several separate organizations to promote and register `` Foundation '' Quarter Horses . American Quarter Horses today ( edit ) The Quarter Horse is well - suited for the western disciplines . The American Quarter Horse is best known today as a show horse , race horse , reining and cutting horse , rodeo competitor , ranch horse , and all - around family horse . Quarter Horses compete well in rodeo events such as barrel racing , calf roping and team roping ; and gymkhana or O - Mok - See . Other stock horse events such as cutting and reining are open to all breeds but also dominated by American Quarter Horse . Large purses allow top competitors to earnover a million dollars in these events . The breed is not only well - suited for western riding and cattle work . Many race tracks offer Quarter Horses a wide assortment of pari - mutuel horse racing with purses in the millions . Quarter Horses have also been trained to compete in dressage and can be good jumpers . They are also used for recreational trail riding and in mounted police units . The American Quarter Horse has also been exported worldwide . European nations such as Germany and Italy have imported large numbers of Quarter Horses . Next to the American Quarter Horse Association ( which also encompasses Quarter Horses from Canada ) , the second largest registry of Quarter Horses is in Brazil , followed by Australia . With the internationalization of the discipline of reining and its acceptance as one of the official seven events of the World Equestrian Games , there is a growing international interest in Quarter Horses . Countries like Japan , Switzerland and Israel that did not have traditional stock horse industries have begun to compete with American Quarter Horses in their own nations and internationally . The American Quarter Horse is the most popular breed in the United States today , and the American Quarter Horse Association is the largest breed registry in the world , with over 5 million American Quarter Horses registered worldwide . Breed characteristics ( edit ) A halter - type Quarter Horse The Quarter Horse has a small , short , refined head with a straight profile , and a strong , well - muscled body , featuring a broad chest and powerful , rounded hindquarters . They usually stand between 14 and 16 hands ( 56 and 64 inches , 142 and 163 cm ) high , although some Halter - type and English hunter - type horses may grow as tall as 17 hands ( 68 inches , 173 cm ) . There are two main body types : the stock type and the hunter or racing type . The stock horse type is shorter , more compact , stocky and well - muscled , yet agile . The racing and hunter type Quarter Horses are somewhat taller and smoother muscled than the stock type , more closely resembling the Thoroughbred . Quarter Horses come in nearly all colors . The most common color is sorrel , a brownish red , part of the color group called chestnut by most other breed registries . Other recognized colors include bay , black , brown , buckskin , palomino , gray , dun , red dun , grullo ( also occasionally referred to as blue dun ) , red roan , blue roan , bay roan , perlino , cremello , and white . In the past , spotted color patterns were excluded , but now with the advent of DNA testing to verify parentage , the registry accepts all colors as long as both parents are registered . Stock type ( edit ) See also : Stock horse A stock horse is a horse of a type that is well suited for working with livestock , particularly cattle . Reining and cutting horses are smaller in stature , with quick , agile movements and very powerful hindquarters . Western pleasure show horses are often slightly taller , with slower movements , smoother gaits , and a somewhat more level topline -- though still featuring the powerful hindquarters characteristic of the Quarter Horse . Halter type ( edit ) Horses shown in - hand in Halter competition are larger yet , with a very heavily muscled appearance , while retaining small heads with wide jowls and refined muzzles . There is controversy amongst owners , breeder and veterinarians regarding the health effects of the extreme muscle mass that is currently fashionable in the specialized halter horse , which typically is 15.2 to 16 hands ( 62 to 64 inches , 157 to 163 cm ) and weighs in at over 1,200 pounds ( 540 kg ) when fitted for halter competition . Not only are there concerns about the weight to frame ratio on the horse 's skeletal system , but the massive build is also linked to HYPP in descendants of the stallion Impressive ( see Genetic diseases below ) . Racing and hunter type ( edit ) A Quarter Horse warming up for hunt seat competition . Quarter Horse race horses are bred to sprint short distances ranging from 220 to 870 yards . Thus , they have long legs and are leaner than their stock type counterparts , but are still characterized by muscular hindquarters and powerful legs . Quarter Horses race primarily against other Quarter Horses , and their sprinting ability has earned them the nickname , `` the world 's fastest athlete . '' The show hunter type is slimmer , even more closely resembling a Thoroughbred , usually reflecting a higher percentage of appendix breeding . They are shown in hunter / jumper classes at both breed shows and in open USEF - rated horse show competition . Genetic diseases ( edit ) There are several genetic diseases of concern to Quarter Horse breeders : Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis ( HYPP ) , which is caused by an autosomal dominant gene linked to the stallion Impressive . It is characterized by uncontrollable muscle twitching and substantial muscle weakness or paralysis among affected horses . Because it is a dominant gene , only one parent has to have the gene for it to be transmitted to offspring . There is a DNA test for HYPP , which is required by the AQHA . Since 2007 , the AQHA bars registration of horses who possess the homozygous form ( H / H ) of the gene , and though heterozygous ( H / N ) horses are still eligible for registration , altering that status is currently being discussed . Additionally all Quarter Horses born 2007 or later that are confirmed to be descendants of Impressive must carry a note about the risks of HYPP on their registration papers . Due to HYPP , the halter classes are undergoing significant changes . Halter classes are dominated by the Impressive bloodline . Impressive , a very prolific halter horse , brought to the stock breeds the muscle mass that is popular in halter competition today . This muscle mass is linked to HYPP , and as the condition is reduced within the breed , the style of horse in halter classes is also likely to change . Already there have been rule changes , including the creation of a `` Performance Halter class '' in which a horse must possess a Register of Merit in performance or racing before it can compete . Malignant hyperthermia . A causative mutated allele , ryanodine receptor 1 gene ( RyR1 ) at nucleotide C7360G , generating a R2454G amino acid substitution . has been identified in the American Quarter Horse and breeds with Quarter Horse ancestry , inherited as an autosomal dominant It can be caused by overwork , anesthesia , or stress . Hereditary Equine Regional Dermal Asthenia ( HERDA ) , also known as hyperelastosis cutis ( HC ) . This is caused by an autosomal recessive gene , and thus , unlike HYPP , HERDA can only be transmitted if both parents carry the gene . When a horse has this disease , there is a collagen defect that results in the layers of skin not being held firmly together . Thus , when the horse is ridden under saddle or suffers trauma to the skin , the outer layer often splits or separates from the deeper layer , or it can tear off completely . It rarely heals without disfiguring scars . Sunburn can also be a concern . In dramatic cases , the skin can split along the back and even roll down the sides , with the horse literally being skinned alive . Most horses with HERDA are euthanized for humane reasons between the age of two and four years . The very hotly debated and controversial theory , put forth by researchers at Cornell University and Mississippi State University is that the sire line of the great foundation stallion Poco Bueno is implicated as the origin of the disease . As of May 9 , 2007 , Researchers working independently at Cornell University and at the University of California , Davis announced that a DNA test for HERDA has been developed . Over 1,500 horses were tested during the development phase of the test , which is now available to the general public through both institutions . Glycogen Branching Enzyme Deficiency ( GBED ) is a genetic disease where the horse is lacking an enzyme necessary for storing glycogen , the horse 's heart muscle and skeletal muscles can not function , leading to rapid death . The disease occurs in foals who are homozygous for the lethal GBED allele , meaning both parents carry one copy of the gene . The stallion King P - 234 has been linked to this disease . There is a DNA blood test for this gene . Equine polysaccharide storage myopathy , also called EPSM or PSSM , is a metabolic muscular condition in horses that causes tying up , and is also related to a glycogen storage disorder . While also seen in some draft horse breeds , PSSM has been traced to three specific but undisclosed bloodlines in Quarter Horses , with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern . 48 % of Quarter Horses with symptoms of neuromuscular disease have PSSM . To some extent it can be diet controlled with specialized low - starch diets , but genetic testing is advised before breeding , as the condition exists at a subclinical level in approximately 6 % of the general Quarter Horse population . Lethal White Syndrome . Although `` cropout '' Quarter Horses with Paint markings were not allowed to be registered for many years , the gene for such markings is a recessive and continued to periodically appear in Quarter Horse foals . Thus , it is believed that some Quarter Horses may carry the gene for Lethal White Syndrome . There is a DNA test for this condition .

Its name came from its ability to outdistance other horse breeds in races of a quarter mile or less ; some have been clocked at speeds up to 55 mph ( 88.5 km / h ) . The American Quarter Horse is the most popular breed in the United States today , and the American Quarter Horse Association is the largest breed registry in the world , with almost 3 million living American Quarter Horses registered in 2014 . The American Quarter Horse is well known both as a race horse and for its performance in rodeos , horse shows and as a working ranch horse . The compact body of the American Quarter Horse is well - suited to the intricate and speedy maneuvers required in reining , cutting , working cow horse , barrel racing , calf roping , and other western riding events , especially those involving live cattle . The American Quarter Horse is also shown in English disciplines , driving , and many other equestrian activities .

One of the most famous of these early imports was Janus , a Thoroughbred who was the grandson of the Godolphin Arabian . He was foaled in 1746 , and imported to colonial Virginia in 1756 . The influence of Thoroughbreds like Janus contributed genes crucial to the development of the colonial `` Quarter Horse '' . The breed is sometimes referred to as the `` Famous American Quarter Running Horse '' . The resulting horse was small , hardy , and quick , and was used as a work horse during the week and a race horse on the weekends . As flat racing became popular with the colonists , the Quarter Horse gained even more popularity as a sprinter over courses that , by necessity , were shorter than the classic racecourses of England , and were often no more than a straight stretch of road or flat piece of open land . When matched against a Thoroughbred , local sprinters often won . As the Thoroughbred breed became established in America , many colonial Quarter Horses were included in the original American stud books , starting a long association between the Thoroughbred breed and what would later become officially known as the `` Quarter Horse '' , named after the ⁄ mile ( 0.40 km ) race distance at which it excelled . with some individuals being clocked at up to 55 mph . Westward expansion ( edit ) In the 19th century , pioneers heading West needed a hardy , willing horse . On the Great Plains , settlers encountered horses that descended from the Spanish stock Hernán Cortés and other Conquistadors had introduced into the viceroyalty of New Spain , which today includes the Southwestern United States and Mexico . These horses of the west included herds of feral animals known as Mustangs , as well as horses domesticated by Native Americans , including the Comanche , Shoshoni and Nez Perce tribes . As the colonial Quarter Horse was crossed with these western horses , the pioneers found that the new crossbred had innate `` cow sense '' , a natural instinct for working with cattle , making it popular with cattlemen on ranches . Development as a distinct breed ( edit ) See also : American Quarter Horse Association and American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame A photograph of Peter McCue , taken in Oklahoma around 1905 . Early foundation sires of Quarter horse type included Steel Dust , foaled 1843 ; Shiloh ( or Old Shiloh ) , foaled 1844 ; Old Cold Deck ( 1862 ) ; Lock 's Rondo , one of many `` Rondo '' horses , foaled in 1880 ; Old Billy -- again , one of many `` Billy '' horses -- foaled circa 1880 ; Traveler , a stallion of unknown breeding , known to have been in Texas by 1889 ; and Peter McCue , foaled 1895 , registered as a Thoroughbred but of disputed pedigree . The main duty of the ranch horse in the American West was working cattle . Even after the invention of the automobile , horses were still irreplaceable for handling livestock on the range . Thus , major Texas cattle ranches , such as the King Ranch , the 6666 ( Four Sixes ) Ranch , and the Waggoner Ranch played a significant role in the development of the modern Quarter Horse . The skills needed by cowboys and their horses became the foundation of the rodeo , a contest which began with informal competition between cowboys and expanded to become a major competitive event throughout the west . To this day , the Quarter Horse dominates the sport both in speed events and in competition that emphasizes the handling of live cattle . However , sprint races were also popular weekend entertainment and racing became a source of economic gain for breeders as well . As a result , more Thoroughbred blood was added back into the developing American Quarter Horse breed . The American Quarter Horse also benefitted from the addition of Arabian , Morgan , and even Standardbred bloodlines . In 1940 , the American Quarter Horse Association ( AQHA ) was formed by a group of horsemen and ranchers from the southwestern United States dedicated to preserving the pedigrees of their ranch horses . The horse honored with the first registration number , P - 1 , was Wimpy , a descendant of the King Ranch foundation sire Old Sorrel . Other sires alive at the founding of the AQHA were given the earliest registration numbers Joe Reed P - 3 , Chief P - 5 , Oklahoma Star P - 6 , Cowboy P - 12 , and Waggoner 's Rainy Day P - 13 . The Thoroughbred race horse Three Bars , alive in the early years of the AQHA , is recognized by the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame as one of the significant foundation sires for the Quarter Horse breed . Other significant Thoroughbred sires seen in early AQHA pedigrees include Rocket Bar , Top Deck and Depth Charge . `` Appendix '' and `` Foundation '' Horses ( edit ) Since the American Quarter Horse formally established itself as a breed , the AQHA stud book has remained open to additional Thoroughbred blood via a performance standard . An `` Appendix '' American Quarter Horse is a first generation cross between a registered Thoroughbred and an American Quarter Horse or a cross between a `` numbered '' American Quarter Horse and an `` appendix '' American Quarter Horse . The resulting offspring is registered in the `` appendix '' of the American Quarter Horse Association 's studbook , hence the nickname . Horses listed in the appendix may be entered in competition , but offspring are not initially eligible for full AQHA registration . If the Appendix horse meets certain conformational criteria and is shown or raced successfully in sanctioned AQHA events , the horse can earn its way from the appendix into the permanent studbook , making its offspring eligible for AQHA registration . Since Quarter Horse / Thoroughbred crosses continue to enter the official registry of the American Quarter Horse breed , this creates a continual gene flow from the Thoroughbred breed into the American Quarter Horse breed , which has altered many of the characteristics that typified the breed in the early years of its formation . Some breeders , who argue that the continued infusion of Thoroughbred bloodlines is beginning to compromise the integrity of the breed standard , favor the earlier style of horse and have created several separate organizations to promote and register `` Foundation '' Quarter Horses . American Quarter Horses today ( edit ) The Quarter Horse is well - suited for the western disciplines . The American Quarter Horse is best known today as a show horse , race horse , reining and cutting horse , rodeo competitor , ranch horse , and all - around family horse . Quarter Horses compete well in rodeo events such as barrel racing , calf roping and team roping ; and gymkhana or O - Mok - See . Other stock horse events such as cutting and reining are open to all breeds but also dominated by American Quarter Horse . Large purses allow top competitors to earnover a million dollars in these events . The breed is not only well - suited for western riding and cattle work . Many race tracks offer Quarter Horses a wide assortment of pari - mutuel horse racing with purses in the millions . Quarter Horses have also been trained to compete in dressage and can be good jumpers . They are also used for recreational trail riding and in mounted police units . The American Quarter Horse has also been exported worldwide . European nations such as Germany and Italy have imported large numbers of Quarter Horses . Next to the American Quarter Horse Association ( which also encompasses Quarter Horses from Canada ) , the second largest registry of Quarter Horses is in Brazil , followed by Australia . With the internationalization of the discipline of reining and its acceptance as one of the official seven events of the World Equestrian Games , there is a growing international interest in Quarter Horses . Countries like Japan , Switzerland and Israel that did not have traditional stock horse industries have begun to compete with American Quarter Horses in their own nations and internationally . The American Quarter Horse is the most popular breed in the United States today , and the American Quarter Horse Association is the largest breed registry in the world , with over 5 million American Quarter Horses registered worldwide . Breed characteristics ( edit ) A halter - type Quarter Horse The Quarter Horse has a small , short , refined head with a straight profile , and a strong , well - muscled body , featuring a broad chest and powerful , rounded hindquarters . They usually stand between 14 and 16 hands ( 56 and 64 inches , 142 and 163 cm ) high , although some Halter - type and English hunter - type horses may grow as tall as 17 hands ( 68 inches , 173 cm ) . There are two main body types : the stock type and the hunter or racing type . The stock horse type is shorter , more compact , stocky and well - muscled , yet agile . The racing and hunter type Quarter Horses are somewhat taller and smoother muscled than the stock type , more closely resembling the Thoroughbred . Quarter Horses come in nearly all colors . The most common color is sorrel , a brownish red , part of the color group called chestnut by most other breed registries . Other recognized colors include bay , black , brown , buckskin , palomino , gray , dun , red dun , grullo ( also occasionally referred to as blue dun ) , red roan , blue roan , bay roan , perlino , cremello , and white . In the past , spotted color patterns were excluded , but now with the advent of DNA testing to verify parentage , the registry accepts all colors as long as both parents are registered . Stock type ( edit ) See also : Stock horse A stock horse is a horse of a type that is well suited for working with livestock , particularly cattle . Reining and cutting horses are smaller in stature , with quick , agile movements and very powerful hindquarters . Western pleasure show horses are often slightly taller , with slower movements , smoother gaits , and a somewhat more level topline -- though still featuring the powerful hindquarters characteristic of the Quarter Horse . Halter type ( edit ) Horses shown in - hand in Halter competition are larger yet , with a very heavily muscled appearance , while retaining small heads with wide jowls and refined muzzles . There is controversy amongst owners , breeder and veterinarians regarding the health effects of the extreme muscle mass that is currently fashionable in the specialized halter horse , which typically is 15.2 to 16 hands ( 62 to 64 inches , 157 to 163 cm ) and weighs in at over 1,200 pounds ( 540 kg ) when fitted for halter competition . Not only are there concerns about the weight to frame ratio on the horse 's skeletal system , but the massive build is also linked to HYPP in descendants of the stallion Impressive ( see Genetic diseases below ) . Racing and hunter type ( edit ) A Quarter Horse warming up for hunt seat competition . Quarter Horse race horses are bred to sprint short distances ranging from 220 to 870 yards . Thus , they have long legs and are leaner than their stock type counterparts , but are still characterized by muscular hindquarters and powerful legs . Quarter Horses race primarily against other Quarter Horses , and their sprinting ability has earned them the nickname , `` the world 's fastest athlete . '' The show hunter type is slimmer , even more closely resembling a Thoroughbred , usually reflecting a higher percentage of appendix breeding . They are shown in hunter / jumper classes at both breed shows and in open USEF - rated horse show competition . Genetic diseases ( edit ) There are several genetic diseases of concern to Quarter Horse breeders : Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis ( HYPP ) , which is caused by an autosomal dominant gene linked to the stallion Impressive . It is characterized by uncontrollable muscle twitching and substantial muscle weakness or paralysis among affected horses . Because it is a dominant gene , only one parent has to have the gene for it to be transmitted to offspring . There is a DNA test for HYPP , which is required by the AQHA . Since 2007 , the AQHA bars registration of horses who possess the homozygous form ( H / H ) of the gene , and though heterozygous ( H / N ) horses are still eligible for registration , altering that status is currently being discussed . Additionally all Quarter Horses born 2007 or later that are confirmed to be descendants of Impressive must carry a note about the risks of HYPP on their registration papers . Due to HYPP , the halter classes are undergoing significant changes . Halter classes are dominated by the Impressive bloodline . Impressive , a very prolific halter horse , brought to the stock breeds the muscle mass that is popular in halter competition today . This muscle mass is linked to HYPP , and as the condition is reduced within the breed , the style of horse in halter classes is also likely to change . Already there have been rule changes , including the creation of a `` Performance Halter class '' in which a horse must possess a Register of Merit in performance or racing before it can compete . Malignant hyperthermia . A causative mutated allele , ryanodine receptor 1 gene ( RyR1 ) at nucleotide C7360G , generating a R2454G amino acid substitution . has been identified in the American Quarter Horse and breeds with Quarter Horse ancestry , inherited as an autosomal dominant It can be caused by overwork , anesthesia , or stress . Hereditary Equine Regional Dermal Asthenia ( HERDA ) , also known as hyperelastosis cutis ( HC ) . This is caused by an autosomal recessive gene , and thus , unlike HYPP , HERDA can only be transmitted if both parents carry the gene . When a horse has this disease , there is a collagen defect that results in the layers of skin not being held firmly together . Thus , when the horse is ridden under saddle or suffers trauma to the skin , the outer layer often splits or separates from the deeper layer , or it can tear off completely . It rarely heals without disfiguring scars . Sunburn can also be a concern . In dramatic cases , the skin can split along the back and even roll down the sides , with the horse literally being skinned alive . Most horses with HERDA are euthanized for humane reasons between the age of two and four years . The very hotly debated and controversial theory , put forth by researchers at Cornell University and Mississippi State University is that the sire line of the great foundation stallion Poco Bueno is implicated as the origin of the disease . As of May 9 , 2007 , Researchers working independently at Cornell University and at the University of California , Davis announced that a DNA test for HERDA has been developed . Over 1,500 horses were tested during the development phase of the test , which is now available to the general public through both institutions . Glycogen Branching Enzyme Deficiency ( GBED ) is a genetic disease where the horse is lacking an enzyme necessary for storing glycogen , the horse 's heart muscle and skeletal muscles can not function , leading to rapid death . The disease occurs in foals who are homozygous for the lethal GBED allele , meaning both parents carry one copy of the gene . The stallion King P - 234 has been linked to this disease . There is a DNA blood test for this gene . Equine polysaccharide storage myopathy , also called EPSM or PSSM , is a metabolic muscular condition in horses that causes tying up , and is also related to a glycogen storage disorder . While also seen in some draft horse breeds , PSSM has been traced to three specific but undisclosed bloodlines in Quarter Horses , with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern . 48 % of Quarter Horses with symptoms of neuromuscular disease have PSSM . To some extent it can be diet controlled with specialized low - starch diets , but genetic testing is advised before breeding , as the condition exists at a subclinical level in approximately 6 % of the general Quarter Horse population . Lethal White Syndrome . Although `` cropout '' Quarter Horses with Paint markings were not allowed to be registered for many years , the gene for such markings is a recessive and continued to periodically appear in Quarter Horse foals . Thus , it is believed that some Quarter Horses may carry the gene for Lethal White Syndrome . There is a DNA test for this condition .

            "Third - level education in the Republic of Ireland - Wikipedia Third - level education in the Republic of Ireland Third - level education in the Republic of Ireland includes all education after second - level , encompassing higher education in universities and colleges and further education on Post Leaving Certificate ( PLC ) and other courses . The degree - awarding authorities approved by the Government of Ireland , which can grant awards at all academic levels , are University of Dublin , National University of Ireland ( Cork , Dublin , Galway and Maynooth ) , Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland , Dublin City University , Dublin Institute of Technology , Higher Education and Training Awards Council , St. Patrick 's College , Maynooth ( Pontifical University ) , and University of Limerick . The King 's Inns of Dublin has a limited role in education specialising in the preparation of candidates for the degree of barrister - at - law to practice as barristers . Medical schools in Ireland also have particular regulation . There were seven establishments of higher education within the Republic of Ireland ranked among the top 500 universities worldwide by the Times Higher Education Supplement in 2008 . Contents 1 Framework 1.1 Institutions 1.2 Fees 2 Further education 3 List of higher education establishments 3.1 Universities 3.2 Institutes of technology 3.3 National institutions 3.4 Colleges of education 3.5 Recognised , associated or constituent colleges of Irish universities 3.6 Independent education 4 Foreign institutions with a presence in Ireland 5 Defunct institutions 6 Footnotes 7 See also 8 References 9 External links Framework ( edit ) EQF level EHEA cycle NFQ level Major award types Level 1 Certificate Level 2 Certificate Level 3 Certificate Junior Certificate Level 4 Certificate Leaving Certificate 5 Level 5 Certificate Leaving Certificate 5 6 Advanced Certificate Short cycle within 1st Higher Certificate 6 1st 7 Ordinary Bachelor 's degree 8 Honours bachelor 's degree Higher diploma 7 2nd 9 Master 's degree Postgraduate diploma 8 3rd 10 Doctorate degree Higher doctorate Institutions ( edit ) Some colleges are `` constituent '' or `` linked '' colleges of universities , while others are designated institutions of the Higher Education and Training Awards Council . The latter include the Institutes of Technology , Colleges of Education , and other independent colleges . Some colleges have `` delegated authority '' from the Higher Education and Training Awards Council , this allows them to confer and validate awards in their own name . Some institutions such as the University of Limerick , Dublin Institute of Technology and Dublin City University ( DCU ) have completed a process of modularising their courses ( others are still in a transition phase ) , mostly using the ECTS . The Bologna process and applied research are the current concerns of national educational policy , additional concerns include the structures of the National University of Ireland and Trinity College , Dublin . Since the mid-2000s , a number of Institutes of Technology have applied for university designation , including Dublin Institute of Technology , Cork and Waterford . The Marks & Standards document , offered by most institutions , can be consulted for information on the range and criteria set down for awards , while programme specifications offer additional information . In contrast to practice in the rest of the education system , entry tends to be highly competitive for school leavers ; the so - called `` Points Race '' . In 2001 the percentage of school leavers transferring to third level exceeded 50 % for the first time , as of 2005 it is in excess of 55 % and expected to grow at approximately 1 % per annum for the next decade . There are over 25 third - level courses at graduate and postgraduate level offered through the Irish language . Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge is the Irish language Department of the National University of Ireland , Galway ( NUI Galway ) and it has different off - campus centres throughout the Gaeltacht regions . Dublin City University has an Irish language department called Fiontar , University College Dublin ( UCD ) , Dublin Institute of Technology and Galway - Mayo Institute of Technology ( GMIT ) also offer similar courses . All but two of the seven universities in the Republic of Ireland offer `` open '' ( omnibus entry ) Bachelor of Arts degrees through the CAO where the student can choose their specialisation after their first year of study . The two universities that do not offer `` open '' ( omnibus entry ) arts degrees , ( Trinity College , Dublin and Dublin City University ) do still offer Bachelor of Arts degrees in specific areas of study such as Drama Studies , Journalism , Latin , History , Japanese and International Relations . In one , Trinity College , Dublin , the applicants wishing to read an Arts degree may apply to the college to read a combination of two subjects , such as French and Philosophy - which the student may continue to read jointly or with focus on one . Dublin City University 's de facto omnibus entry arts degree is offered by St. Patrick 's College of Education ( a college of DCU ) and is titled `` BA in Humanities '' , All Hallows College ( a college of DCU ) offer BA in Humanities , Theology Pastoral Care , and English . Entry into Higher education institutions is normally done through the CAO or Central Applications Office . In this way , students wishing to enter university apply to the CAO rather than the individual university . Places in courses are usually awarded based on results in the Leaving Certificate Examination or any international equivalent . Each university has a minimum entry requirement , usually requiring a pass grade in either English or Irish , as well as maths . Some also require a pass grade in a modern continental European language ( French , German , Spanish or Italian ) . Each individual course has further entry requirements , for example , science courses usually require a certain grade in one or two sciences . The student must also achieve the number of points required for the course under the points system . However , universities also have systems in place for accepting mature students , and students who have successfully completed a Post Leaving Certificate or Further Education course . Entry into third - level is generally very high in the Republic of Ireland ( as it also is in Northern Ireland ) , and among young adults ( those aged 25 to 34 ) , 41.6 % of them have attained third - level degrees -- the second highest level in the EU after Cyprus , and substantially ahead of the average of 29.1 % . Broken down by gender , approximately 43 % of women and 40 % of men Ireland attend third level education . Fees ( edit ) Under the `` Free Fees Initiative '' the Exchequer will pay the tuition fees of students who meet relevant course , nationality and residence requirements as set down under the initiative . These requirements include : Holding EU nationality , or are a national of member country of the European Economic Area or Switzerland , or those who have been granted official refugee status . Having been a resident in an EU Member State for at least three of the five years preceding entry to the course . Are not undertaking a second undergraduate course . Students are required to pay a `` registration fee '' on entry to their courses . These charges cover costs such as equipment usage , administration fees and exam fees . Charges for 2008 / 09 were on average € 850 per student , but was raised to € 1,500 per student for the 2009 / 10 school year . These charges have been labelled as `` unofficial fees '' , and University Heads have admitted that `` student registration charges are fees by any other name '' . In 2011 , after large annual increases , the Registration Fee was abolished and replaced with a Student Contribution . For the school year 2015 / 2016 this fee stands at € 3,000 . Further education ( edit ) See also : List of further education colleges in the Republic of Ireland Further education is vocational and technical education and training in post-compulsory education . Awards are offered by a multitude of bodies , both ad - hoc and statutory . Typical areas included apprenticeships , childcare , farming , retail , and tourism . These are typical areas of the economy that do not depend on multinational investment and recognition . There are many different types of further education awards , known as Post Leaving Certificates . The Further Education and Training Awards Council conferred awards in the extra-university system . Further education has expanded immensely in recent years helped by the institutions , and because of this the type and range of these awards have been formalized to restore confidence . There are two separate schemes enabling progression for holders of FETAC awards to Universities and Institutes of Technology . FETAC awards carried points that can be used to access higher education . FETAC was dissolved and its functions were passed to Quality and Qualifications Ireland ( QQI ) on November 6 , 2012 .

            "List of FIFA World Cup finals - wikipedia List of FIFA World Cup finals For a list of FIFA Women 's World Cup finals , see List of FIFA Women 's World Cup finals . List of FIFA World Cup finals France celebrating after their win against Croatia in the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final Founded 1930 Region International ( FIFA ) Number of teams 204 ( qualifiers ) 32 ( finals ) Current champions France ( 2nd title ) Most successful team ( s ) Brazil ( 5 titles ) The FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition established in 1930 . It is contested by the men 's national teams of the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association ( FIFA ) , the sport 's global governing body . The tournament has taken place every four years , except in 1942 and 1946 , when the competition was cancelled due to World War II . The most recent World Cup , hosted by Russia in 2018 , was won by France , who beat Croatia 4 -- 2 in regulation time . The World Cup final match is the last of the competition , and the result determines which country is declared world champions . If after 90 minutes of regular play the score is a draw , an additional 30 - minute period of play , called extra time , is added . If such a game is still tied after extra time , it is then decided by a penalty shoot - out . The team winning the penalty shoot - out are then declared champions . The tournament has been decided by a one - off match on every occasion except 1950 , when the tournament winner was decided by a final round - robin group contested by four teams ( Uruguay , Brazil , Sweden , and Spain ) . Uruguay 's 2 -- 1 victory over Brazil was the decisive match ( and one of the last two matches of the tournament ) which put them ahead on points and ensured that they finished top of the group as world champions . Therefore , this match is regarded by FIFA as the de facto final of the 1950 World Cup . In the 21 tournaments held , 79 nations have appeared at least once . Of these , 13 have made it to the final match , and eight have won . With five titles , Brazil is the most successful World Cup team and also the only nation to have participated in every World Cup finals tournament . Italy and Germany have four titles . Current champion France , along with past champions Uruguay and Argentina , have two titles each , while England and Spain have one each . The team that wins the finals receive the FIFA World Cup Trophy , and their name is engraved on the bottom side of the trophy . The 1970 and 1994 , along with the 1986 , 1990 and 2014 games are to date the only matches competed by the same teams ( Brazil -- Italy and Argentina -- Germany respectively ) . As of 2018 , the 1934 final remains the latest final to have been between two teams playing their first final . The final match of the most recent tournament in Russia took place at the country 's biggest sports complex , the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow . The 1930 and the 1966 games are the only ones that did not take place on a Sunday . The former did on a Wednesday and the latter on a Saturday . As of 2018 , only nations from Europe and South America have competed in a World Cup final . Six nations have won the final as host : Uruguay , Italy , England , Germany , Argentina and France . Two nations have lost the final as host : Brazil and Sweden .

Political career ( edit ) For many years Van Wyck took an active interest in Democratic Party matters , attending many conventions , state and national . Later , Van Wyck was elected Judge of the City Court of New York . He advanced to Chief Justice . Van Wyck resigned as justice to accept the Democratic Party nomination for Mayor of New York City . He was elected in 1897 by a very large majority . He served as mayor of New York City between 1898 and 1901 , as the first mayor to govern New York City after its five boroughs had been consolidated into a single city . As Mayor , he brought together the innumerable municipal corporations comprising the greater city , adjusting their finances and bringing order out of almost total chaos . He directed construction of the Interborough Rapid Transit , the first subway in Manhattan , and provided for the construction of the proposed Brooklyn Tunnel . Van Wyck is generally regarded as a colorless mayor , selected by the leaders of Tammany Hall as a man who would do little to interfere with their running of the city . Initially highly popular as a result of his reversal of the various reforms introduced by the preceding Fusion administration , Van Wyck 's administration foundered on the so - called ' Ice Trust ' scandal of 1900 . The New York World reported that the American Ice Company of Charles W. Morse planned to double the price of ice , from 30 to 60 cents per hundred pounds ( from 66 cents to 1.32 dollars per 100 kilograms ) . In the era before refrigeration , this had potentially fatal effects , as ice was the only preservative available to keep food , milk , and medicines fresh . The high price would have put ice beyond reach of many of the city 's poor -- Tammany 's main power base in the years of waves of immigration . American Ice was forced to reverse its decision due to the public outcry . Van Wyck 's political rivals forced an investigation into the issue . It revealed that American Ice had secured an effective monopoly over the supply of its product to the city -- it was the only company with rights to land ice at New York piers -- and would have dramatically increased its profits at the new price . In addition , Van Wyck , whose salary as mayor was only $15,000 , owned , and had apparently not paid for , $680,000 worth of American Ice stock . The Ice Trust Scandal destroyed Van Wyck 's political career and was generally reckoned to have cost Tammany the elections of 1901 , which was won by the Fusion reformist slate led by Seth Low . Two years later , the New York Times characterized the Van Wyck administration as one mired in `` black ooze and slime '' . Governor Theodore Roosevelt initiated an investigation , which determined that Van Wyck had not been personally implicated in the Ice Trust Scandal . Later years ( edit ) Van Wyck and his wife enjoyed traveling . In 1906 , they moved to Paris , France . He died there at the age of 69 on November 14 , 1918 . The funeral was held at American Holy Trinity Church . His body was returned to New York and he was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx , New York City .

            "Hail Mary - wikipedia Hail Mary Jump to : navigation , search `` Ave Maria '' redirects here . For other uses , see Ave Maria ( disambiguation ) . For other uses , see Hail Mary ( disambiguation ) . The Annunciation , by Fra Angelico The Hail Mary , also commonly called the Ave Maria ( Latin ) or Angelic Salutation , is a traditional Catholic prayer asking for the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary , the mother of Jesus . In Roman Catholicism , the prayer forms the basis of the Rosary and the Angelus prayers . In the Oriental Orthodox Churches , Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches , a similar prayer is used in formal liturgies , both in Greek and in translations . It is also used by many other groups within the catholic tradition of Christianity including Anglicans , Independent Catholics , and Old Catholics . Some Protestant denominations , such as Lutherans , also make use of a form of the prayer . Based on the greeting of the archangel Gabriel to the Virgin Mary in the Gospel of Luke , the prayer takes different forms in various traditions . It has often been set to music . Contents ( hide ) 1 Biblical source 2 In Western ( Latin ) tradition 3 Eastern Christian use 3.1 In Greek tradition 3.2 Slavonic versions 4 Roman Catholic use 5 Anglican use 6 Lutheran use 7 Musical settings 8 See also 9 References 10 External links Biblical source ( edit ) The prayer incorporates two passages from Saint Luke 's Gospel : `` Hail , the Lord is with thee . '' and `` Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb . '' In mid-13th - century Western Europe the prayer consisted only of these words with the single addition of the name `` Mary '' after the word `` Hail '' , as is evident from the commentary of Saint Thomas Aquinas on the prayer . The first of the two passages from Saint Luke 's Gospel is the greeting of the Angel Gabriel to Mary , originally written in Koine Greek . The opening word of greeting , χαῖρε , chaíre , here translated `` Hail '' , literally has the meaning `` rejoice '' or `` be glad '' . This was the normal greeting in the language in which Saint Luke 's Gospel is written and continues to be used in the same sense in Modern Greek . Accordingly , both `` Hail '' and `` Rejoice '' are valid English translations of the word ( `` Hail '' reflecting the Latin translation , and `` Rejoice '' reflecting the original Greek ) . The word κεχαριτωμένη , ( kecharitōménē ) , here translated as `` full of grace '' , admits of various translations . Grammatically , the word is the feminine perfect passive participle of the verb χαριτόω , charitóō , which means `` to show , or bestow with , grace '' and here , in the passive voice , `` to have grace shown , or bestowed upon , one '' . The text also appears in the account of the annunciation contained in the apocryphal Infancy Gospel of Matthew , in chapter 9 . The second passage is taken from Elizabeth 's greeting to Mary in Luke 1 : 42 , `` Blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb . '' Taken together , these two passages are the two times Mary is greeted in Chapter 1 of Luke . In Western ( Latin ) tradition ( edit ) Part of a series on the Mariology of the Catholic Church The Immaculate Conception , by Murillo Overview ( show ) Prayers Antiphons Hymns to Mary Devotional practices Prayers ( show ) Angelus Fátima Prayers Flos Carmeli Hail Mary Hail Mary of Gold Immaculata prayer Magnificat Mary , Mother of Grace Mary Our Queen Memorare Sub tuum praesidium Antiphons ( show ) Alma Redemptoris Mater Ave Maris Stella Ave Regina Caelorum Salve Regina Hymns to Mary ( show ) Hail Queen of Heaven , the Ocean Star Immaculate Mary Lo , How a Rose E'er Blooming O Sanctissima Regina Coeli Stabat Mater Devotional practices ( show ) Acts of Reparation Consecration to Mary First Saturdays Rosary Seven Joys of the Virgin Seven Sorrows of Mary Three Hail Marys Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary Catholicism portal After considering the use of similar words in Syriac , Greek and Latin in the 6th century , Herbert Thurston , writing in the Catholic Encyclopedia concludes that `` there is little or no trace of the Hail Mary as an accepted devotional formula before about 1050 '' , ( though a later pious tale attributed to Ildephonsus of Toledo ( fl . 7th century ) the use of the first part , namely the angel 's greeting Mary , without that of Elizabeth , as a prayer ) . All the evidence suggests that it took its rise from certain versicles and responsories occurring in the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary , which just at that time was coming into favour among the monastic orders . Saint Thomas Aquinas spoke of the name `` Mary '' as the only word added at his time to the Biblical text , to indicate the person who was `` full of grace . '' But at about the same time the name `` Jesus '' was also added , to specify who was meant by the phrase `` the fruit of thy womb . '' The Western version of the prayer is thus not derived from the Greek version : even the earliest Western forms have no trace of the Greek version 's phrases : `` Mother of God and Virgin '' and `` for thou hast given birth to the Saviour of our souls . '' To the greeting and praise of Mary of which the prayer thus consisted , a petition `` Holy Mary , Mother of God , pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death . Amen . '' was added later . The petition first appeared in print in 1495 in Girolamo Savonarola 's `` Esposizione sopra l'Ave Maria . '' The `` Hail Mary '' prayer in Savonarola 's exposition reads : `` Hail Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with thee ; blessed art thou amongst women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb , Jesus . Holy Mary , Mother of God , pray for us sinners , now and at the hour of our death . Amen '' The petition was commonly added around the time of the Council of Trent . The Dutch Jesuit St. Petrus Canisius is credited with adding in 1555 in his Catechism the sentence Holy Mary , Mother of God , pray for us sinners . Eleven years later , the sentence was included in the Catechism of the Council of Trent of 1566 . The `` Catechism of the Council of Trent '' says that to the first part of the Hail Mary , by which `` we render to God the highest praise and return Him most gracious thanks , because He has bestowed all His heavenly gifts on the most holy Virgin ... the Church of God has wisely added prayers and an invocation addressed to the most holy Mother of God ... we should earnestly implore her help and assistance ; for that she possesses exalted merits with God , and that she is most desirous to assist us by her prayers , no one can doubt without impiety and wickedness . '' The beginning of the verse in historiated letters in the book of hours Heures de Charles d'Angoulême The current Latin version is thus as follows , with accents added to indicate how the prayer is said in the current ecclesiastical pronunciation of Latin : Áve María , grátia pléna , Dóminus técum . Benedícta tū in muliéribus , et benedíctus frúctus véntris túi , Iésus . Sáncta María , Máter Déi , óra pro nóbis peccatóribus , nunc et in hóra mórtis nóstrae . Ámen . Hail Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with thee . Blessed art thou amongst women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb , Jesus . Holy Mary , Mother of God , pray for us sinners , now and at the hour of our death . Amen . On account of its connection with the Angelus , the Ave Maria was often inscribed on bells . Eastern christian use ( edit ) In Greek tradition ( edit ) The Hail Mary prayer of the Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches is in the form Θεοτόκε Παρθένε , χαῖρε , κεχαριτωμένη Μαρία , ὁ Κύριος μετὰ σοῦ . εὐλογημένη σὺ ἐν γυναιξί , καὶ εὐλογημένος ὁ καρπὸς τῆς κοιλίας σου , ὅτι Σωτῆρα ἔτεκες τῶν ψυχῶν ἡμῶν . God - bearing Virgin , rejoice , grace - filled Mary , the Lord with thee . Praised thou among women , and praised the fruit of thy womb , because it was the Saviour of our souls that thou borest . Another English rendering of the same text reads : Mother of God and Virgin , rejoice , Mary full of grace , the Lord is with thee . Blessed art thou amongst women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb , for thou hast given birth to the Saviour of our souls . To the Biblical texts this adds the opening invocation `` Theotokos Virgin , '' the name `` Mary '' and the concluding `` because it was the Saviour of our souls that thou bearest '' . In the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic churches , the prayer is very common in the Greek form indicated above , or in translations from it . Although it is not said quite as often as in the West , it is well known and often used and appears in several canons of prayer . It is typically sung thrice at the end of Vespers during an All - Night Vigil , as well as occurring many times in the course of daily prayer . Slavonic versions ( edit ) There exist two variant versions in Church Slavonic : Cyrillic Romanization English Translation Богородице дѣво радѹйсѧ ѡбрадованнаѧ Марїе Господь съ тобою благословена ты въ женахъ , и благословенъ плодъ чрева твоегѡ , Якѡ родила еси Христа Спаса , Избавителѧ дѹшамъ нашимъ . Bogoroditse Djevo , raduisya , Obradovannaya Marie , Gospodh s ' toboyu . Blagoslovena tyh v ' zhenach , Y blagosloven plod chreva Tvoego , Yako rodila esi Christa Spasa , Izbavitelya dusham nashim . Theotokos Virgin , rejoice , ( or : Rejoice , O Virgin Theotokos ) Mary full of grace , the Lord is with thee . Blessed art thou amongst women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb , for thou hast borne Christ the Saviour , the Deliverer of our souls . Богородице дѣво , радѹйсѧ , Благодатнаѧ Марїе , Господь съ тобою : благословена Ты въ женахъ , и благословенъ плодъ чрева Твоегѡ ; якѡ Спаса родила еси дѹшъ нашихъ . Bogoroditse Djevo , raduisya , Blagodatnaya Marie , Gospod s ' toboyu : Blagoslovyena tyh v ' zhenakh , Y blagoslovyen plod chreva Tvoyego , yako Spasa rodila yesi dush nashikh . Theotokos Virgin , rejoice , ( or : Rejoice , O Virgin Theotokos ) Mary full of grace , The Lord is with thee . Blessed art thou amongst women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb , for thou hast borne the Saviour of our souls . Church Slavonic Bogorodice děvo in traditional Cyrillic script The first is the older , and remains in use by the Old Believers as well as those who follow the Ruthenian recension ( among them the Ukrainian Greek - Catholic Church and the Ruthenian Catholic Church ) . The second , corresponding more closely to the Greek , appeared in 1656 under the liturgical reforms of Patriarch Nikon of Moscow , and is in use by the Russian Orthodox Church , the Serbian Orthodox Church , the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church ) . Roman Catholic use ( edit ) The Hail Mary is the central part of the Angelus , a devotion generally recited thrice daily by many Catholics , as well as broad & high church Anglicans , and Lutherans who usually omit the second half . The Hail Mary is the essential element of the Rosary , a prayer method in use especially among Roman Rite ( Western ) Catholics . The Eastern Catholic Churches say a similar version . The Rosary consists traditionally of three sets of five Mysteries , each mystery consisting of one `` decade '' or ten Ave Marias . The 150 Ave Marias of the Rosary thus echo the 150 psalms . These meditate upon events of Jesus ' life during his childhood ( Joyful Mysteries ) , Passion ( Sorrowful Mysteries ) , and from his Resurrection onwards ( Glorious Mysteries ) . Another set , the Luminous Mysteries , is of comparatively recent origin , having been proposed by Pope John Paul II in 2002 . Each of these Mysteries is prayed as a decade ( a unit of ten ) , consisting of one Our Father ( Pater Noster or The Lord 's Prayer ) , ten Hail Marys , and one ' Glory Be ' ( Gloria Patri ) ( Doxology ) . The restatement of the prayers locks one into fixed language , having the effect of freeing the conscious mind so that the recitation may come more from the heart and not the head . Pope Paul V said that `` the Rosary is a treasure of graces '' . Even for those souls who pray without meditating , the simple act of taking the beads in hand to pray is already a remembrance of God -- of the supernatural `` . Anglican use ( edit ) Anglicans also employ the Hail Mary in devotional practice . Traditional Anglicism uses the prayer in much the same way as Roman Catholics , including use of the Rosary and the recitation of the Angelus . Many Anglican churches contain statues of the Virgin Mary , and the faithful use devotional prayers including the Hail Mary . Lutheran use ( edit ) Martin Luther , the founder of Lutheranism , believed that Mary should be held in highest reverence . Although he did not agree with Mary 's veneration , he did advocate the use of the first half of the Hail Mary ( that is , `` Hail Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with thee . Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb , Jesus . '' ) as a sign of reverence for and devotion to the Virgin . Musical settings ( edit ) See also : Roman Catholic Marian music The Hail Mary , or Ave Maria in Latin , has been set to music numerous times . Arguably the two most famous settings are : the version by Franz Schubert ( 1825 ) ; originally composed as Ave Maria ( Ellens Gesang III , D839 , Op 52 no 6 , 1825 ) , Ellen 's third song in English , as part of his Opus 52 , a setting of seven songs from Walter Scott 's popular epic poem `` The Lady of the Lake '' , and was translated into German by Adam Storck , used in the final segment of Walt Disney 's Fantasia , opening with the greeting `` Ave Maria '' ( `` Hail Mary '' ) , but not a setting of the traditional Ave Maria prayer ; but nowadays commonly sung with the words of the traditional prayer . the version by Charles Gounod ( 1859 ) , adding melody and words to Johann Sebastian Bach 's first prelude from The Well - Tempered Clavier Anton Bruckner wrote three different settings , the best known being a motet for seven voices . Antonín Dvořák 's version was composed in 1877 . Another setting of Ave Maria was written by Giuseppe Verdi for his 1887 opera Otello . Russian composer César Cui , who was raised Roman Catholic , set the text at least three times : as the `` Ave Maria '' , op . 34 , for one or two women 's voices with piano or harmonium ( 1886 ) , and as part of two of his operas : Le flibustier ( premiered 1894 ) and Mateo Falcone ( 1907 ) . Settings also exist by Mozart , Liszt , Byrd , Elgar , Saint - Saëns , Rossini , Brahms , Stravinsky , Lauridsen , Franz Biebl , David Conte and Perosi as well as numerous versions by less well - known composers , such as J.B. Tresch and Ninel Samokhvalova . `` Ave Maria '' The prayer as a traditional Latin Gregorian chant `` Ave Maria '' The second of Anton Bruckner 's three settings of `` Ave Maria '' Problems playing these files ? See media help . In Slavonic , the text was also a popular subject for setting to music by Eastern European composers . These include Rachmaninov , Stravinsky , Bortniansky , Vavilov ( his version often misattributed to Caccini ) , Mikhail Shukh , Lyudmyla Hodzyumakha and others . This text was also very often set by composers in the Renaissance , including Josquin des Prez , Orlando di Lasso , and Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina . Before the Council of Trent there were actually different versions of the text , so the earlier composers in the period sometimes set versions of the text different from the ones shown above . Josquin des Prez , for example , himself set more than one version of the Ave Maria . Here is the text of his motet Ave Maria ... Virgo serena , which begins with the first six words above and continues with a poem in rhymed couplets . Hail Mary ( Annunciation ) , Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry , Chantilly Museum Ave Maria , gratia plena , Dominus tecum , Virgo serena . Ave cuius conceptio , solemni plena gaudio , celestia , terrestria , nova replet letitia . Ave cuius nativitas , nostra fuit solemnitas , ut lucifer lux oriens verum solem preveniens . Ave pia humilitas , sine viro fecunditas , cuius annunciatio nostra fuit salvatio . Ave vera virginitas , immaculata castitas , cuius purificatio nostra fuit purgatio . Ave preclara omnibus angelicis virtutibus , cuius fuit assumptio nostra glorificatio . O Mater Dei , memento mei . Amen . The much anthologized Ave Maria by Jacques Arcadelt is actually a 19th - century arrangement by Pierre - Louis Dietsch , loosely based on Arcadelt 's three part madrigal Nous voyons que les hommes . Even though Protestant Christianity generally avoids any special veneration of Mary , access to the beautiful and culturally significant tradition of Marian music is facilitated by substitution texts . These texts are intended to replace the words of the standard `` Ave Maria '' , preserving word boundaries and syllable stresses , so that music written for the former text can be sung with the latter . An example is the Christ - centric Ave Redemptor : English translation Ave redemptor , Domine Iesus : Cuius ob opus Superatur mors , enim salvatio Nunc inundavit super universam terram . Sancte redemptor , reputata Fides est nobis peccatoribus , Nunc et in morte , ad iustitiam . Hail the Redeemer , Lord Jesus , By whose work Death is defeated , for salvation Has now overflowed upon all of the world . Holy redeemer , our faith Is reckoned to us sinners , Now and in death , as righteousness . A famous setting for the Orthodox version of the prayer in Church Slavonic ( Bogoroditsye Djevo ) was composed by Sergei Rachmaninoff in his All - Night Vigil .

It has , for example , been applied to both states and territories . When used in connection with areas under U.S. sovereignty that are not states , the term broadly describes an area that has a constitution of its adoption . Puerto Rico ( Spanish for `` Rich Port '' ) , officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ( Spanish : Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico , lit . `` Free Associated State of Puerto Rico '' ) and briefly called Porto Rico , is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea . An archipelago among the Greater Antilles , Puerto Rico includes the main island of Puerto Rico and a number of smaller ones , such as Mona , Culebra , and Vieques . The capital and most populous city is San Juan . Its official languages are Spanish and English , though Spanish predominates . The island 's population is approximately 3.4 million . Puerto Rico 's history , tropical climate , natural scenery , traditional cuisine , and tax incentives make it a destination for travelers from around the world . Originally populated by the indigenous Taíno people , the island was claimed in 1493 by Christopher Columbus for Spain during his second voyage . Later it endured invasion attempts from the French , Dutch , and British . Four centuries of Spanish colonial government influenced the island 's cultural landscapes with waves of African slaves , Canarian , and Andalusian settlers . In the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary , but strategic role when compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and the mainland parts of New Spain . Spain 's distant administrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century , helping to produce a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined elements from the Native Americans , Africans , and Iberians . In 1898 , following the Spanish -- American War , the United States acquired Puerto Rico under the terms of the Treaty of Paris . The treaty took effect on April 11 , 1899 . Puerto Ricans are by law natural - born citizens of the United States and may move freely between the island and the mainland . As it is not a state , Puerto Rico does not have a vote in the United States Congress , which governs the territory with full jurisdiction under the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950 . However , Puerto Rico does have one non-voting member of the House called a Resident Commissioner . As a U.S. territory , American citizens residing in Puerto Rico are disenfranchised at the national level and do not vote for president and vice president of the United States , and do not pay federal income tax on Puerto Rican income . Like other territories and the District of Columbia , Puerto Rico does not have U.S. senators . Congress approved a local constitution , allowing U.S. citizens on the territory to elect a governor . A 2012 referendum showed a majority ( 54 % of those who voted ) disagreed with `` the present form of territorial status '' . A second question asking about a new model , had full statehood the preferred option among those who voted for a change of status , although a significant number of people did not answer the second question of the referendum . Another fifth referendum was held on June 11 , 2017 , with `` Statehood '' and `` Independence / Free Association '' initially as the only available choices . At the recommendation of the Department of Justice , an option for the `` current territorial status '' was added . The referendum showed an overwhelming support for statehood , with 97.18 % voting for it , although the voter turnout had a historically low figure of only 22.99 % of the registered voters casting their ballots . In early 2017 , the Puerto Rican government - debt crisis posed serious problems for the government . The outstanding bond debt had climbed to $70 billion at a time with 12.4 % unemployment . The debt had been increasing during a decade long recession . This was the second major financial crisis to affect the island after the Great Depression when the U.S. government , in 1935 , provided relief efforts through the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration . On May 3 , 2017 , Puerto Rico 's financial oversight board in the U.S. District Court for Puerto Rico filed the debt restructuring petition which was made under Title III of PROMESA . By early August 2017 , the debt was $72 billion with a 45 % poverty rate . In late September 2017 , Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico causing devastating damage . The island 's electrical grid was largely destroyed , with repairs expected to take months to complete , provoking the largest power outage in American history . Recovery efforts were somewhat slow in the first few months , and over 200,000 residents had moved to Florida alone by late November 2017 .

Puerto Ricans often call the island Borinquén -- a derivation of Borikén , its indigenous Taíno name , which means `` Land of the Valiant Lord '' . The terms boricua and borincano derive from Borikén and Borinquen respectively , and are commonly used to identify someone of Puerto Rican heritage . The island is also popularly known in Spanish as la isla del encanto , meaning `` the island of enchantment '' . Columbus named the island San Juan Bautista , in honor of Saint John the Baptist , while the capital city was named Ciudad de Puerto Rico ( `` Rich Port City '' ) . Eventually traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico , while San Juan became the name used for the main trading / shipping port and the capital city . The island 's name was changed to `` Porto Rico '' by the United States after the Treaty of Paris of 1898 . The anglicized name was used by the U.S. government and private enterprises . The name was changed back to Puerto Rico by a joint resolution in Congress introduced by Félix Córdova Dávila in 1931 . The official name of the entity in Spanish is Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico ( `` free associated state of Puerto Rico '' ) , while its official English name is Commonwealth of Puerto Rico . History Main article : History of Puerto Rico Pre-columbian era A reconstructed Taíno village at the Tibes Ceremonial Center The ancient history of the archipelago which is now Puerto Rico is not well known . Unlike other indigenous cultures in the New World ( Aztec , Maya and Inca ) which left behind abundant archeological and physical evidence of their societies , scant artifacts and evidence remain of the Puerto Rico 's indigenous population . Scarce archaeological findings and early Spanish accounts from the colonial era constitute all that is known about them . The first comprehensive book on the history of Puerto Rico was written by Fray Íñigo Abbad y Lasierra in 1786 , nearly three centuries after the first Spaniards landed on the island . The first known settlers were the Ortoiroid people , an Archaic Period culture of Amerindian hunters and fishermen who migrated from the South American mainland . Some scholars suggest their settlement dates back about 4,000 years . An archeological dig in 1990 on the island of Vieques found the remains of a man , designated as the `` Puerto Ferro Man '' , which was dated to around 2000 BC . The Ortoiroid were displaced by the Saladoid , a culture from the same region that arrived on the island between 430 and 250 BC . The Igneri tribe migrated to Puerto Rico between 120 and 400 AD from the region of the Orinoco river in northern South America . The Arcaico and Igneri co-existed on the island between the 4th and 10th centuries . Between the 7th and 11th centuries , the Taíno culture developed on the island . By approximately 1000 AD , it had become dominant . At the time of Columbus ' arrival , an estimated 30,000 to 60,000 Taíno Amerindians , led by the cacique ( chief ) Agüeybaná , inhabited the island . They called it Boriken , meaning `` the great land of the valiant and noble Lord '' . The natives lived in small villages , each led by a cacique . They subsisted by hunting and fishing , done generally by men , as well as by the women 's gathering and processing of indigenous cassava root and fruit . This lasted until Columbus arrived in 1493 . Spanish colony ( 1493 -- 1898 ) Further information : Captaincy General of Puerto Rico Juan Ponce de León ( Santervás de Campos , Valladolid , Spain ) , Puerto Rico 's first governor Conquest and early settlement When Columbus arrived in Puerto Rico during his second voyage on November 19 , 1493 , the island was inhabited by the Taíno . They called it Borikén ( Borinquen in Spanish transliteration ) . Columbus named the island San Juan Bautista , in honor of St John the Baptist . Having reported the findings of his first travel , Columbus brought with him this time a letter from King Ferdinand empowered by a papal bull that authorized any course of action necessary for the expansion of the Spanish Empire and the Christian faith . Juan Ponce de León , a lieutenant under Columbus , founded the first Spanish settlement , Caparra , on August 8 , 1508 . He later served as the first governor of the island . Eventually , traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico , and San Juan became the name of the main trading / shipping port . At the beginning of the 16th century , the Spanish people began to colonize the island . Despite the Laws of Burgos of 1512 and other decrees for the protection of the indigenous population , some Taíno Indians were forced into an encomienda system of forced labor in the early years of colonization . The population suffered extremely high fatalities from epidemics of European infectious diseases . Colonization , the habsburgs In 1520 , King Charles I of Spain issued a royal decree collectively emancipating the remaining Taíno population . By that time , the Taíno people were few in number . Enslaved Africans had already begun to be imported to compensate for the native labor loss , but their numbers were proportionate to the diminished commercial interest Spain soon began to demonstrate for the island colony . Other nearby islands , like Cuba , Saint - Domingue , and Guadeloupe , attracted more of the slave trade than Puerto Rico , probably because of greater agricultural interests in those islands , on which colonists had developed large sugar plantations and had the capital to invest in the Atlantic slave trade . From the beginning of the country , the colonial administration relied heavily on the industry of enslaved Africans and creole blacks for public works and defenses , primarily in coastal ports and cities , where the tiny colonial population had hunkered down . With no significant industries or large - scale agricultural production as yet , enslaved and free communities lodged around the few littoral settlements , particularly around San Juan , also forming lasting Afro - creole communities . Meanwhile , in the island 's interior , there developed a mixed and independent peasantry that relied on a subsistence economy . This mostly unsupervised population supplied villages and settlements with foodstuffs and , in relative isolation , set the pattern for what later would be known as the Puerto Rican Jíbaro culture . By the end of the 16th century , the Spanish Empire was diminishing and , in the face of increasing raids from European competitors , the colonial administration throughout the Americas fell into a `` bunker mentality '' . Imperial strategists and urban planners redesigned port settlements into military posts with the objective of protecting Spanish territorial claims and ensuring the safe passing of the king 's silver - laden Atlantic Fleet to the Iberian Peninsula . San Juan served as an important port - of - call for ships driven across the Atlantic by its powerful trade winds . West Indies convoys linked Spain to the island , sailing between Cádiz and the Spanish West Indies . The colony 's seat of government was on the forested Islet of San Juan and for a time became one of the most heavily fortified settlements in the Spanish Caribbean earning the name of the `` Walled City '' . The islet is still dotted with the various forts and walls , such as La Fortaleza , Castillo San Felipe del Morro , and Castillo San Cristóbal , designed to protect the population and the strategic Port of San Juan from the raids of the Spanish European competitors . Hendricksz 1625 attack on San Juan , Puerto Rico In 1625 , in the Battle of San Juan , the Dutch commander Boudewijn Hendricksz tested the defenses ' limits like no one else before . Learning from Francis Drake 's previous failures here , he circumvented the cannons of the castle of San Felipe del Morro and quickly brought his 17 ships into the San Juan Bay . He then occupied the port and attacked the city while the population hurried for shelter behind the Morro 's moat and high battlements . Historians consider this event the worst attack on San Juan . Though the Dutch set the village on fire , they failed to conquer the Morro , and its batteries pounded their troops and ships until Hendricksz deemed the cause lost . Hendricksz 's expedition eventually helped propel a fortification frenzy . Constructions of defenses for the San Cristóbal Hill were soon ordered so as to prevent the landing of invaders out of reach of the Morro 's artillery . Urban planning responded to the needs of keeping the colony in Spanish hands . Late colonial period Hacienda La Fortuna . A sugar mill complex in Puerto Rico painted by Francisco Oller in 1885 ( Brooklyn Museum ) During the late 16th and early 17th centuries , Spain concentrated its colonial efforts on the more prosperous mainland North , Central , and South American colonies . With the advent of the lively Bourbon Dynasty in Spain in the 1700s , the island of Puerto Rico began a gradual shift to more imperial attention . More roads began connecting previously isolated inland settlements to coastal cities , and coastal settlements like Arecibo , Mayaguez , and Ponce began acquiring importance of their own , separate from San Juan . By the end of the 18th century , merchant ships from an array of nationalities threatened the tight regulations of the Mercantilist system , which turned each colony solely toward the European metropole and limited contact with other nations . U.S. ships came to surpass Spanish trade and with this also came the exploitation of the island 's natural resources . Slavers , which had made but few stops on the island before , began selling more enslaved Africans to growing sugar and coffee plantations . The increasing number of Atlantic wars in which the Caribbean islands played major roles , like the War of Jenkins ' Ear , the Seven Years ' War and the Atlantic Revolutions , ensured Puerto Rico 's growing esteem in Madrid 's eyes . On April 17 , 1797 , Sir Ralph Abercromby 's fleet invaded the island with a force of 6,000 -- 13,000 men , which included German soldiers and Royal Marines and 60 to 64 ships . Fierce fighting continued for the next days with Spanish troops . Both sides suffered heavy losses . On Sunday April 30 the British ceased their attack and began their retreat from San Juan . By the time independence movements in the larger Spanish colonies gained success , new waves of loyal creole immigrants began to arrive in Puerto Rico , helping to tilt the island 's political balance toward the Crown . The 16th - century fort , Castillo San Felipe del Morro , in San Juan , Puerto Rico In 1809 , to secure its political bond with the island and in the midst of the European Peninsular War , the Supreme Central Junta based in Cádiz recognized Puerto Rico as an overseas province of Spain . This gave the island residents the right to elect representatives to the recently convened Spanish parliament ( Cádiz Cortes ) , with equal representation to mainland Iberian , Mediterranean ( Balearic Islands ) and Atlantic maritime Spanish provinces ( Canary Islands ) . Ramón Power y Giralt , the first Spanish parliamentary representative from the island of Puerto Rico , died after serving a three - year term in the Cortes . These parliamentary and constitutional reforms were in force from 1810 to 1814 , and again from 1820 to 1823 . They were twice reversed during the restoration of the traditional monarchy by Ferdinand VII . Immigration and commercial trade reforms in the 19th century increased the island 's ethnic European population and economy and expanded the Spanish cultural and social imprint on the local character of the island . Minor slave revolts had occurred on the island throughout the years , with the revolt planned and organized by Marcos Xiorro in 1821 being the most important . Even though the conspiracy was unsuccessful , Xiorro achieved legendary status and is part of Puerto Rico 's folklore . Politics of liberalism The flag flown by Fidel Vélez and his men during the `` Intentona de Yauco '' revolt In the early 19th century , Puerto Rico spawned an independence movement that , due to harsh persecution by the Spanish authorities , convened in the island of St. Thomas . The movement was largely inspired by the ideals of Simón Bolívar in establishing a United Provinces of New Granada and Venezuela , that included Puerto Rico and Cuba . Among the influential members of this movement were Brigadier General Antonio Valero de Bernabé and María de las Mercedes Barbudo . The movement was discovered , and Governor Miguel de la Torre had its members imprisoned or exiled . With the increasingly rapid growth of independent former Spanish colonies in the South and Central American states in the first part of the 19th century , the Spanish Crown considered Puerto Rico and Cuba of strategic importance . To increase its hold on its last two New World colonies , the Spanish Crown revived the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815 as a result of which 450,000 immigrants , mainly Spaniards , settled on the island in the period up until the American conquest . Printed in three languages -- Spanish , English , and French -- it was intended to also attract non-Spanish Europeans , with the hope that the independence movements would lose their popularity if new settlers had stronger ties to the Crown . Hundreds of non Spanish families , mainly from Corsica , France , Germany , Ireland , Italy and Scotland , also immigrated to the island . Free land was offered as an incentive to those who wanted to populate the two islands , on the condition that they swear their loyalty to the Spanish Crown and allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church . The offer was very successful , and European immigration continued even after 1898 . Puerto Rico still receives Spanish and European immigration . The Lares Revolutionary Flag Poverty and political estrangement with Spain led to a small but significant uprising in 1868 known as Grito de Lares . It began in the rural town of Lares , but was subdued when rebels moved to the neighboring town of San Sebastián . Leaders of this independence movement included Ramón Emeterio Betances , considered the `` father '' of the Puerto Rican independence movement , and other political figures such as Segundo Ruiz Belvis . Slavery was abolished in Puerto Rico in 1873 , `` with provisions for periods of apprenticeship '' . Abolition Park in Ponce , Puerto Rico Leaders of `` El Grito de Lares '' went into exile in New York City . Many joined the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee , founded on December 8 , 1895 , and continued their quest for Puerto Rican independence . In 1897 , Antonio Mattei Lluberas and the local leaders of the independence movement in Yauco organized another uprising , which became known as the Intentona de Yauco . They raised what they called the Puerto Rican flag , which was adopted as the national flag . The local conservative political factions opposed independence . Rumors of the planned event spread to the local Spanish authorities who acted swiftly and put an end to what would be the last major uprising in the island to Spanish colonial rule . In 1897 , Luis Muñoz Rivera and others persuaded the liberal Spanish government to agree to grant limited self - government to the island by royal decree in the Autonomic Charter , including a bicameral legislature . In 1898 , Puerto Rico 's first , but short - lived , quasi-autonomous government was organized as an `` overseas province '' of Spain . This bilaterally agreed - upon charter maintained a governor appointed by the King of Spain -- who held the power to annul any legislative decision -- and a partially elected parliamentary structure . In February , Governor - General Manuel Macías inaugurated the new government under the Autonomic Charter . General elections were held in March and the new government began to function on July 17 , 1898 . American era ( 1898 -- present ) Main article : Puerto Rican Campaign In 1890 , Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan , a member of the Navy War Board and leading U.S. strategic thinker , published a book titled The Influence of Sea Power upon History in which he argued for the establishment of a large and powerful navy modeled after the British Royal Navy . Part of his strategy called for the acquisition of colonies in the Caribbean , which would serve as coaling and naval stations . They would serve as strategic points of defense with the construction of a canal through the Isthmus of Panama , to allow easier passage of ships between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans . The first company of Puerto Ricans enlisted in the U.S. Army , 1899 William H. Seward , the former Secretary of State under presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson , had also stressed the importance of building a canal in Honduras , Nicaragua or Panama . He suggested that the United States annex the Dominican Republic and purchase Puerto Rico and Cuba . The U.S. Senate did not approve his annexation proposal , and Spain rejected the U.S. offer of 160 million dollars for Puerto Rico and Cuba . Since 1894 , the United States Naval War College had been developing contingency plans for a war with Spain . By 1896 , the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence had prepared a plan that included military operations in Puerto Rican waters . Except for one 1895 plan , which recommended annexation of the island then named Isle of Pines ( later renamed as Isla de la Juventud ) , a recommendation dropped in later planning , plans developed for attacks on Spanish territories were intended as support operations against Spain 's forces in and around Cuba . Recent research suggests that the U.S. did consider Puerto Rico valuable as a naval station , and recognized that it and Cuba generated lucrative crops of sugar -- a valuable commercial commodity which the United States lacked , before the development of the Sugar Beet industry in the United States . Children in a company housing settlement , 1941 On July 25 , 1898 , during the Spanish -- American War , the U.S. invaded Puerto Rico with a landing at Guánica . As an outcome of the war , Spain ceded Puerto Rico , along with the Philippines and Guam , then under Spanish sovereignty , to the U.S. under the Treaty of Paris , which went into effect on April 11 , 1899 . Spain relinquished sovereignty over Cuba , but did not cede it to the U.S. United States unincorporated organized territory ( 1900 -- 1952 ) The United States and Puerto Rico began a long - standing metropolis - colony relationship . In the early 20th century , Puerto Rico was ruled by the military , with officials including the governor appointed by the President of the United States . The Foraker Act of 1900 gave Puerto Rico a certain amount of civilian popular government , including a popularly elected House of Representatives . The upper house and governor were appointed by the United States . The First Supreme Court of Puerto Rico , appointed pursuant to the Foraker Act Its judicial system was constructed to follow the American legal system ; a Puerto Rico Supreme Court and a United State District Court for the territory were established . It was authorized a non-voting member of Congress , by the title of `` Resident Commissioner '' , who was appointed . In addition , this Act extended all U.S. laws `` not locally inapplicable '' to Puerto Rico , specifying , in particular , exemption from U.S. Internal Revenue laws . The Act empowered the civil government to legislate on `` all matters of legislative character not locally inapplicable '' , including the power to modify and repeal any laws then in existence in Puerto Rico , though the U.S. Congress retained the power to annul acts of the Puerto Rico legislature . During an address to the Puerto Rican legislature in 1906 , President Theodore Roosevelt recommended that Puerto Ricans become U.S. citizens . In 1914 , the Puerto Rican House of Delegates voted unanimously in favor of independence from the United States , but this was rejected by the U.S. Congress as `` unconstitutional '' , and in violation of the 1900 Foraker Act . U.S. citizenship and Puerto Rican citizenship In 1917 , the U.S. Congress passed the Jones -- Shafroth Act , popularly called the Jones Act , which granted Puerto Ricans , born on or after , April 25 , 1898 , U.S. citizenship . Opponents , which included all of the Puerto Rican House of Delegates , who voted unanimously against it , said that the U.S. imposed citizenship in order to draft Puerto Rican men into the army as American entry into World War I became likely . The same Act provided for a popularly elected Senate to complete a bicameral Legislative Assembly , as well as a bill of rights . It authorized the popular election of the Resident Commissioner to a four - year term . Soldiers of the 65th Infantry training in Salinas , Puerto Rico ( August 1941 ) Natural disasters , including a major earthquake and tsunami in 1918 , and several hurricanes , and the Great Depression impoverished the island during the first few decades under U.S. rule . Some political leaders , such as Pedro Albizu Campos , who led the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party , demanded change in relations with the United States . He organized a protest at the University of Puerto Rico in 1935 , in which four were killed by police . In 1936 , U.S. Senator Millard Tydings introduced a bill supporting independence for Puerto Rico , but it was opposed by Luis Muñoz Marín of the Liberal Party of Puerto Rico . ( Tydings had co-sponsored the Tydings -- McDuffie Act , which provided independence to the Philippines after a 10 - year transition under a limited autonomy . ) All the Puerto Rican parties supported the bill , but Muñoz Marín opposed it . Tydings did not gain passage of the bill . In 1937 , Albizu Campos ' party organized a protest in which numerous people were killed by police in Ponce . The Insular Police , resembling the National Guard , opened fire upon unarmed cadets and bystanders alike . The attack on unarmed protesters was reported by the U.S. Congressman Vito Marcantonio and confirmed by the report of the Hays Commission , which investigated the events . The commission was led by Arthur Garfield Hays , counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union . Nineteen people were killed and over 200 were badly wounded , many in their backs while running away . The Hays Commission declared it a massacre and police mob action , and it has since been known as the Ponce massacre . In the aftermath , on April 2 , 1943 , Tydings introduced a bill in Congress calling for independence for Puerto Rico . This bill ultimately was defeated . During the latter years of the Roosevelt -- Truman administrations , the internal governance was changed in a compromise reached with Luis Muñoz Marín and other Puerto Rican leaders . In 1946 , President Truman appointed the first Puerto Rican - born governor , Jesús T. Piñero . Since 2007 , the Puerto Rico State Department has developed a protocol to issue certificates of Puerto Rican citizenship to Puerto Ricans . In order to be eligible , applicants must have been born in Puerto Rico ; born outside of Puerto Rico to a Puerto Rican -- born parent ; or be an American citizen with at least one year of residence in Puerto Rico . United States unincorporated organized territory with Commonwealth Constitution ( 1952 -- present ) In 1947 , the U.S. granted Puerto Ricans the right to democratically elect their own governor . In 1948 , Luis Muñoz Marín became the first popularly elected governor of Puerto Rico . Painting of bayonet charge by the U.S. 65th Infantry Regiment , made up of Puerto Rican troops , against a Chinese division during the Korean War A bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and nationalist movements in the island . The Senate at the time was controlled by the Popular Democratic Party ( PPD ) , and was presided over by Luis Muñoz Marín . The bill , also known as the Gag Law ( Spanish : Ley de la Mordaza ) , was approved by the legislature on May 21 , 1948 . It made it illegal to display a Puerto Rican flag , to sing a pro-independence tune , to talk of independence , or to campaign for independence . The bill , which resembled the Smith Act passed in the United States , was signed and made into law on June 10 , 1948 , by the U.S. appointed governor of Puerto Rico , Jesús T. Piñero , and became known as `` Law 53 '' ( Spanish : Ley 53 ) . In accordance with this law , it would be a crime to print , publish , sell , exhibit , organize or help anyone organize any society , group or assembly of people whose intentions are to paralyze or destroy the insular government . Anyone accused and found guilty of disobeying the law could be sentenced to ten years of prison , be fined $10,000 ( U.S. ) , or both . According to Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa , a member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives , the law was repressive and in violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution , which guarantees Freedom of Speech . He asserted that the law as such was a violation of the civil rights of the people of Puerto Rico . The law was repealed in 1957 . Estado Libre Asociado In 1950 , the U.S. Congress granted Puerto Ricans the right to organize a constitutional convention via a referendum that gave them the option of voting their preference , `` yes '' or `` no '' , on a proposed U.S. law that would organize Puerto Rico as a `` commonwealth '' that would continue United States sovereignty over Puerto Rico and its people . Puerto Rico 's electorate expressed its support for this measure in 1951 with a second referendum to ratify the constitution . The Constitution of Puerto Rico was formally adopted on July 3 , 1952 . The Constitutional Convention specified the name by which the body politic would be known . On February 4 , 1952 , the convention approved Resolution 22 which chose in English the word Commonwealth , meaning a `` politically organized community '' or `` state '' , which is simultaneously connected by a compact or treaty to another political system . Puerto Rico officially designates itself with the term `` Commonwealth of Puerto Rico '' in its constitution , as a translation into English of the term to `` Estado Libre Asociado '' ( ELA ) . In 1967 Puerto Rico 's Legislative Assembly polled the political preferences of the Puerto Rican electorate by passing a plebiscite act that provided for a vote on the status of Puerto Rico . This constituted the first plebiscite by the Legislature for a choice among three status options ( commonwealth , statehood , and independence ) . In subsequent plebiscites organized by Puerto Rico held in 1993 and 1998 ( without any formal commitment on the part of the U.S. Government to honor the results ) , the current political status failed to receive majority support . In 1993 , Commonwealth status won by a plurality of votes ( 48.6 % versus 46.3 % for statehood ) , while the `` none of the above '' option , which was the Popular Democratic Party - sponsored choice , won in 1998 with 50.3 % of the votes ( versus 46.5 % for statehood ) . Disputes arose as to the definition of each of the ballot alternatives , and Commonwealth advocates , among others , reportedly urged a vote for `` none of the above '' . In 1950 , the U.S. Congress approved Public Law 600 ( P.L. 81 - 600 ) , which allowed for a democratic referendum in Puerto Rico to determine whether Puerto Ricans desired to draft their own local constitution . This Act was meant to be adopted in the `` nature of a compact '' . It required congressional approval of the Puerto Rico Constitution before it could go into effect , and repealed certain sections of the Organic Act of 1917 . The sections of this statute left in force were entitled the Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act . U.S. Secretary of the Interior Oscar L. Chapman , under whose Department resided responsibility of Puerto Rican affairs , clarified the new commonwealth status in this manner : `` The bill ( to permit Puerto Rico to write its own constitution ) merely authorizes the people of Puerto Rico to adopt their own constitution and to organize a local government ... The bill under consideration would not change Puerto Rico 's political , social , and economic relationship to the United States . '' External video Puerto Rico , U.S. Embassy in Vienna , October 24 , 2014 View newsreel scenes in Spanish of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s on YouTube On October 30 , 1950 , Pedro Albizu Campos and other nationalists led a three - day revolt against the United States in various cities and towns of Puerto Rico , in what is known as the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s . The most notable occurred in Jayuya and Utuado . In the Jayuya revolt , known as the Jayuya Uprising , the Puerto Rican governor declared martial law , and attacked the insurgents in Jayuya with infantry , artillery and bombers under control of the Puerto Rican commander . The Utuado uprising culminated in what is known as the Utuado massacre . On November 1 , 1950 , Puerto Rican nationalists from New York City , Griselio Torresola and Oscar Collazo , attempted to assassinate President Harry S. Truman at his temporary residence of Blair House . Torresola was killed during the attack , but Collazo was wounded and captured . He was convicted of murder and sentenced to death , but President Truman commuted his sentence to life . After Collazo served 29 years in a federal prison , President Jimmy Carter commuted his sentence to times served and he was released in 1979 . Pedro Albizu Campos served many years in a federal prison in Atlanta , for seditious conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. government in Puerto Rico . The Constitution of Puerto Rico was approved by a Constitutional Convention on February 6 , 1952 , and 82 % of the voters in a March referendum . It was modified and ratified by the U.S. Congress , approved by President Truman on July 3 of that year , and proclaimed by Gov. Muñoz Marín on July 25 , 1952 . This was the anniversary of July 25 , 1898 , landing of U.S. troops in the Puerto Rican Campaign of the Spanish -- American War , until then celebrated as an annual Puerto Rico holiday . A shantytown along the Martin Peña Channel ( 1973 ) Puerto Rico adopted the name of Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico ( literally `` Associated Free State of Puerto Rico '' ) , officially translated into English as Commonwealth , for its body politic . `` The United States Congress legislates over many fundamental aspects of Puerto Rican life , including citizenship , the currency , the postal service , foreign policy , military defense , communications , labor relations , the environment , commerce , finance , health and welfare , and many others . '' During the 1950s and 1960s , Puerto Rico experienced rapid industrialization , due in large part to Operación Manos a la Obra ( `` Operation Bootstrap '' ) , an offshoot of FDR 's New Deal . It was intended to transform Puerto Rico 's economy from agriculture - based to manufacturing - based to provide more jobs . Puerto Rico has become a major tourist destination , as well as a global center for pharmaceutical manufacturing . Referendums on statehood or independence Four referendums have been held since the late 20th century to resolve the political status . The 2012 referendum showed a majority ( 54 % of the voters ) in favor of a change in status , with full statehood the preferred option of those who wanted a change . Because there were almost 500,000 blank ballots in the 2012 referendum , creating confusion as to the voters ' true desire , Congress decided to ignore the vote . The first three plebiscites provided voters with three options : statehood , free association , and independence . The Puerto Rican status referendum , 2017 in June 2017 was going to offer only two options : Statehood and Independence / Free Association . However , a letter from the Donald Trump administration recommended adding the Commonwealth , the current status , in the plebiscite . The option had been removed from this plebiscite in response to the results of the plebiscite in 2012 which asked whether to remain in the current status and No had won . The Trump administration cited changes in demographics during the past 5 years to add the option once again . Amendments to the plebiscite bill were adopted making ballot wording changes requested by the Department of Justice , as well as adding a `` current territorial status '' option . While 97 percent voted in favor of statehood , the turnout was low ; only some 23 percent voted . After the ballots were counted the Justice Department was non-committal . The Justice Department had asked for the 2017 plebiscite to be postponed but the Rosselló government chose not to do so . After the outcome was announced , the department told the Associated Press that it had `` not reviewed or approved the ballot 's language '' . Former Governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá ( 2005 -- 2009 ) is convinced that statehood is not the solution for either the U.S. or for Puerto Rico `` for economic , identity and cultural reasons '' . He pointed out that voter turnout for the 2017 referendum was extremely low , and suggests that a different type of mutually - beneficial relationship should be found . If the federal government agrees to discuss an association agreement , the conditions would be negotiated between the two entities . The agreement might cover topics such as the role of the U.S. military in Puerto Rico , the use of the U.S. currency , free trade between the two entities , and whether Puerto Ricans would be U.S. citizens . The three current Free Associated States ( Marshall Islands , Micronesia and Palau ) use the American dollar , receive some financial support and the promise of military defense if they refuse military access to any other country . Their citizens are allowed to work in the U.S. and serve in its military . Governor Ricardo Rosselló is strongly in favor of statehood to help develop the economy and help to `` solve our 500 - year - old colonial dilemma ... Colonialism is not an option ... It 's a civil rights issue ... 3.5 million citizens seeking an absolute democracy , '' he told the news media . Benefits of statehood include an additional $10 billion per year in federal funds , the right to vote in presidential elections , higher Social Security and Medicare benefits , and a right for its government agencies and municipalities to file for bankruptcy . The latter is currently prohibited . Statehood might be useful as a means of dealing with the financial crisis , since it would allow for bankruptcy and the relevant protection . According to the Government Development Bank , this might be the only solution to the debt crisis . Congress has the power to vote to allow Chapter 9 protection without the need for statehood , but in late 2015 there was very little support in the House for this concept . Other benefits to statehood include increased disability benefits and Medicaid funding , the right to vote in Presidential elections and the higher ( federal ) minimum wage . Subsequent to the 2017 referendum , Puerto Rico 's legislators are also expected to vote on a bill that would allow the Governor to draft a state constitution and hold elections to choose senators and representatives to the federal Congress . In spite of the outcome of the referendum , and the so - called Tennessee Plan ( above ) , action by the United States Congress would be necessary to implement changes to the status of Puerto Rico under the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution . United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization Since 1953 , the UN has been considering the political status of Puerto Rico and how to assist it in achieving `` independence '' or `` decolonization '' . In 1978 , the Special Committee determined that a `` colonial relationship '' existed between the U.S. and Puerto Rico . The UN 's Special Committee on Decolonization has often referred to Puerto Rico as a `` nation '' in its reports , because , internationally , the people of Puerto Rico are often considered to be a Caribbean nation with their own national identity . Most recently , in a June 2016 report , the Special Committee called for the United States to expedite the process to allow self - determination in Puerto Rico . More specifically , the group called on the United States to expedite a process that would allow the people of Puerto Rico to exercise fully their right to self - determination and independence ... allow the Puerto Rican people to take decisions in a sovereign manner , and to address their urgent economic and social needs , including unemployment , marginalization , insolvency and poverty `` . International status On November 27 , 1953 , shortly after the establishment of the Commonwealth , the General Assembly of the United Nations approved Resolution 748 , removing Puerto Rico 's classification as a non-self - governing territory . The General Assembly did not apply the full list of criteria which was enunciated in 1960 when it took favorable note of the cessation of transmission of information regarding the non-self - governing status of Puerto Rico . According to the White House Task Force on Puerto Rico 's Political Status in its December 21 , 2007 report , the U.S. , in its written submission to the UN in 1953 , never represented that Congress could not change its relationship with Puerto Rico without the territory 's consent . It stated that the U.S. Justice Department in 1959 reiterated that Congress held power over Puerto Rico pursuant to the Territorial Clause of the U.S. Constitution . In 1993 the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit stated that Congress may unilaterally repeal the Puerto Rican Constitution or the Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act and replace them with any rules or regulations of its choice . In a 1996 report on a Puerto Rico status political bill , the U.S. House Committee on Resources stated , `` Puerto Rico 's current status does not meet the criteria for any of the options for full self - government under Resolution 1541 '' ( the three established forms of full self - government being stated in the report as ( 1 ) national independence , ( 2 ) free association based on separate sovereignty , or ( 3 ) full integration with another nation on the basis of equality ) . The report concluded that Puerto Rico `` ... remains an unincorporated colony and does not have the status of ' free association ' with the United States as that status is defined under United States law or international practice '' , that the establishment of local self - government with the consent of the people can be unilaterally revoked by the U.S. Congress , and that U.S. Congress can also withdraw the U.S. citizenship of Puerto Rican residents of Puerto Rico at any time , for a legitimate Federal purpose . The application of the U.S. Constitution to Puerto Rico is limited by the Insular Cases . In 2006 , 2007 , 2009 , 2010 , and 2011 the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization passed resolutions calling on the United States to expedite a process `` that would allow Puerto Ricans to fully exercise their inalienable right to self - determination and independence '' , and to release all Puerto Rican political prisoners in U.S. prisons , to clean up , decontaminate and return the lands in the islands of Vieques and Culebra to the people of Puerto Rico , to perform a probe into U.S. human rights violations on the island and a probe into the killing by the FBI of pro-independence leader Filiberto Ojeda Rios . 21st century Further information : Proposed political status for Puerto Rico ; Puerto Rican status referendum , 2012 ; and President 's Task Force on Puerto Rico 's Status Puerto Rican status referendum , 2012 Location Puerto Rico Date November 6 , 2012 ; 5 years ago ( 2012 - 11 - 06 ) Voting system simple majority for the first question first - past - the - post for the second question Should Puerto Rico continue its current territorial status ? Yes 46.00 % No 54.00 % Which non-territorial option do you prefer ? Statehood 61.16 % Sovereign Free Associated State 33.34 % Independence 5.49 % There were 515,348 blank and invalidated ballots counted alongside the 1,363,854 ballots which indicated a choice for one of the non-territorial alternatives . Under Puerto Rico Law , these ballots are not considered cast votes and are therefore not reflected in the final tally . On July 15 , 2009 , the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization approved a draft resolution calling on the Government of the United States to expedite a process that would allow the Puerto Rican people to exercise fully their inalienable right to self - determination and independence . On April 29 , 2010 , the U.S. House voted 223 -- 169 to approve a measure for a federally sanctioned process for Puerto Rico 's self - determination , allowing Puerto Rico to set a new referendum on whether to continue its present form of commonwealth , or to have a different political status . If Puerto Ricans voted to continue as a commonwealth , the Government of Puerto Rico was authorized to conduct additional plebiscites at intervals of every eight years from the date on which the results of the prior plebiscite were certified ; if Puerto Ricans voted to have a different political status , a second referendum would determine whether Puerto Rico would become a U.S. state , an independent country , or a sovereign nation associated with the U.S. that would not be subject to the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution . During the House debate , a fourth option , to retain its present form of commonwealth ( sometimes referred to as `` the status quo '' ) political status , was added as an option in the second plebiscite . Immediately following U.S. House passage , H.R. 2499 was sent to the U.S. Senate , where it was given two formal readings and referred to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources . On December 22 , 2010 , the 111th United States Congress adjourned without any Senate vote on H.R. 2499 , killing the bill . The latest Task Force report was released on March 11 , 2011 . The report suggested a two - plebiscite process , including a `` first plebiscite that requires the people of Puerto Rico to choose whether they wish to be part of the United States ( either via Statehood or Commonwealth ) or wish to be independent ( via Independence or Free Association ) . If continuing to be part of the United States were chosen in the first plebiscite , a second vote would be taken between Statehood and Commonwealth . '' On June 14 , 2011 , President Barack Obama `` promised to support ' a clear decision ' by the people of Puerto Rico on statehood '' . That same month , the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization passed a resolution and adopted a consensus text introduced by Cuba 's delegate on June 20 , 2011 , calling on the United States to expedite a process `` that would allow Puerto Ricans to fully exercise their inalienable right to self - determination and independence '' . On November 6 , 2012 , a two - question referendum took place , simultaneous with the general elections . The first question asked voters whether they wanted to maintain the current status under the territorial clause of the U.S. Constitution . The second question posed three alternate status options if the first question was approved : statehood , independence or free association . For the first question , 54 percent voted against the current Commonwealth status . For the second question , 61.16 % voted for statehood , 33.34 % for a sovereign free associated state , and 5.49 % for independence . There were also 515,348 blank and invalidated ballots , which are not reflected in the final tally , as they are not considered cast votes under Puerto Rico law . On December 11 , 2012 , Puerto Rico 's Legislature passed a concurrent resolution to request to the President and the U.S. Congress action on November 6 , 2012 plebiscite results . But on April 10 , 2013 , with the issue still being widely debated , the White House announced that it will seek $2.5 million to hold another referendum , this next one being the first Puerto Rican status referendum to be financed by the U.S. Federal government . In December 2015 , the U.S. Government submitted a brief as Amicus Curiae to the U.S. Supreme Court related to the case Commonwealth of Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle . The U.S. Government official position is that the U.S. Constitution does not contemplate `` sovereign territories '' . That the Court has consistently recognized that `` there is no sovereignty in a Territory of the United States but that of the United States itself '' . and a U.S. territory has `` no independent sovereignty comparable to that of a state . That is because `` the Government of a territory owes its existence wholly to the United States '' . Congress 's plenary authority over federal territories includes the authority to permit self - government , whereby local officials administer a territory 's internal affairs . On June 9 , 2016 , in Commonwealth of Puerto Rico vs Sanchez Valle , a 6 -- 2 majority of the Supreme Court of the United States determined that Puerto Rico is a territory and lacks Sovereignty . On June 30 , 2016 , the President of the United States of America signed a new law approved by U.S. Congress , H.R. 5278 : PROMESA , establishing a Control Board over the Puerto Rico Government . This board will have a significant degree of federal control involved in its establishment and operations . In particular , the authority to establish the control board derives from the federal government 's constitutional power to `` make all needful rules and regulations '' regarding U.S. territories ; The President would appoint all seven voting members of the board ; and the board would have broad sovereign powers to effectively overrule decisions by Puerto Rico 's legislature , governor , and other public authorities . Political status The latest referendum on statehood , independence , or an associated republic was held on November 6 , 2012 . The people of Puerto Rico made history by requesting , for the first time ever , the conclusion of the island 's current territorial status . Almost 78 % of registered voters participated in a plebiscite held to resolve Puerto Rico 's status , and a slim but clear majority ( 54 % ) disagreed with Puerto Rico maintaining its present territorial status . Furthermore , among the possible alternatives , sixty - one percent ( 61 % ) of voters chose the statehood option , while one third of the ballots were submitted blank . On December 11 , 2012 , the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico enacted a concurrent resolution requesting the President and the Congress of the United States to respond to the referendum of the people of Puerto Rico , held on November 6 , 2012 , to end its current form of territorial status and to begin the process to admit Puerto Rico as a State . The initiative has not made Puerto Rico into a state . In May , 2017 , the Natural Resources Defense Council reported that Puerto Rico 's water system was the worst as measured by the Clean Water Act . 70 % of the population drank water that violated U.S. law . Post Hurricane recovery In late September 2017 , Hurricane Maria hit the island as a Category 4 storm causing severe damage to homes , other buildings and infrastructure . The recovery as of late November was slow but progress had been made . Electricity was restored to two - thirds of the island , although there was some doubt as to the number of residents getting reliable power . In January 2018 , it was reported that close to 40 percent of the island 's customers still did not have electricity . The vast majority had access to water but were still required to boil it . The number still living in shelters had dropped to 982 with thousands of others living with relatives . The official death toll at the time was 58 but some sources indicated that the actual number is much higher . A dam on the island was close to failure and officials were concerned about additional flooding from this source . Thousands had left Puerto Rico , with close to 200,000 having arrived in Florida alone . Those who were then living on the mainland experienced difficulty in getting health care benefits . A New York Times report on November 27 said it was understandable that Puerto Ricans wanted to leave the island . `` Basic essentials are hard to find and electricity and other utilities are unreliable or entirely inaccessible . Much of the population has been unable to return to jobs or to school and access to health care has been severely limited . '' The Center for Puerto Rican Studies at New York 's Hunter College estimated that some half million people , about 14 % of the population , may permanently leave by 2019 . The total damage on the island was estimated as up to $95 billion . By the end of November , FEMA had received over a million applications for aid and had approved about a quarter of those . The US government had agreed in October to provide funding to rebuild and up to $4.9 billion in loans to help the island 's government . FEMA had $464 million earmarked to help local governments rebuild public buildings and infrastructure . Bills for other funding were being considered in Washington but little progress had been made on those . A November 28 , 2017 report by the Sierra Club included this comment : `` It will take years to rebuild Puerto Rico , not just from the worst hurricane to make landfall since 1932 , but to sustainably overcome environmental injustices which made Maria 's devastation even more catastrophic '' . Geography Main articles : Geography of Puerto Rico and Geology of Puerto Rico A map of Puerto Rico Puerto Rico consists of the main island of Puerto Rico and various smaller islands , including Vieques , Culebra , Mona , Desecheo , and Caja de Muertos . Of these five , only Culebra and Vieques are inhabited year - round . Mona , which has played a key role in maritime history , is uninhabited most of the year except for employees of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources . There are many other even smaller islets , like Monito , which is near to Mona , Isla de Cabras and La Isleta de San Juan , both located on the San Juan Bay . The latter is the only inhabited islet with communities like Old San Juan and Puerta de Tierra , and connected to the main island by bridges . The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has an area of 13,790 square kilometers ( 5,320 sq mi ) , of which 8,870 km ( 3,420 sq mi ) is land and 4,921 km ( 1,900 sq mi ) is water . Puerto Rico is larger than two U.S. states , Delaware and Rhode Island . The maximum length of the main island from east to west is 180 km ( 110 mi ) , and the maximum width from north to south is 65 km ( 40 mi ) . Puerto Rico is the smallest of the Greater Antilles . It is 80 % of the size of Jamaica , just over 18 % of the size of Hispaniola and 8 % of the size of Cuba , the largest of the Greater Antilles . The island is mostly mountainous with large coastal areas in the north and south . The main mountain range is called `` La Cordillera Central '' ( The Central Range ) . The highest elevation in Puerto Rico , Cerro de Punta 1,338 meters ( 4,390 ft ) , is located in this range . Another important peak is El Yunque , one of the highest in the Sierra de Luquillo at the El Yunque National Forest , with an elevation of 1,065 m ( 3,494 ft ) . The coast at Patillas , Puerto Rico Puerto Rico has 17 lakes , all man - made , and more than 50 rivers , most originating in the Cordillera Central . Rivers in the northern region of the island are typically longer and of higher water flow rates than those of the south , since the south receives less rain than the central and northern regions . Puerto Rico is composed of Cretaceous to Eocene volcanic and plutonic rocks , overlain by younger Oligocene and more recent carbonates and other sedimentary rocks . Most of the caverns and karst topography on the island occurs in the northern region in the carbonates . The oldest rocks are approximately 190 million years old ( Jurassic ) and are located at Sierra Bermeja in the southwest part of the island . They may represent part of the oceanic crust and are believed to come from the Pacific Ocean realm . Puerto Rico lies at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American plates and is being deformed by the tectonic stresses caused by their interaction . These stresses may cause earthquakes and tsunamis . These seismic events , along with landslides , represent some of the most dangerous geologic hazards in the island and in the northeastern Caribbean . The most recent major earthquake occurred on October 11 , 1918 , and had an estimated magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale . It originated off the coast of Aguadilla , several kilometers off the northern coast , and was accompanied by a tsunami . It caused extensive property damage and widespread losses , damaging infrastructure , especially bridges . It resulted in an estimated 116 deaths and $4 million in property damage . The failure of the government to move rapidly to provide for the general welfare contributed to political activism by opponents and eventually to the rise of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party . The Puerto Rico Trench , the largest and deepest trench in the Atlantic , is located about 115 km ( 71 mi ) north of Puerto Rico at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American plates . It is 280 km ( 170 mi ) long . At its deepest point , named the Milwaukee Deep , it is almost 8,400 m ( 27,600 ft ) deep . Climate Puerto Rico seen from space ( STS - 34 mission ) Main article : Climate of Puerto Rico The climate of Puerto Rico in the Köppen climate classification is tropical rainforest . Temperatures are warm to hot year round , averaging near 85 ° F ( 29 ° C ) in lower elevations and 70 ° F ( 21 ° C ) in the mountains . Easterly trade winds pass across the island year round . Puerto Rico has a rainy season which stretches from April into November . The mountains of the Cordillera Central are the main cause of the variations in the temperature and rainfall that occur over very short distances . The mountains can also cause wide variation in local wind speed and direction due to their sheltering and channeling effects adding to the climatic variation . The island has an average temperature of 82.4 ° F ( 28 ° C ) throughout the year , with an average minimum temperature of 66.9 ° F ( 19 ° C ) and maximum of 85.4 ° F ( 30 ° C ) . Daily temperature changes seasonally are quite small in the lowlands and coastal areas . The temperature in the south is usually a few degrees higher than the north and temperatures in the central interior mountains are always cooler than those on the rest of the island . Between the dry and wet season , there is a temperature change of around 6 ° F ( 3.3 ° C ) . This is mainly due to the warm waters of the tropical Atlantic Ocean , which significantly modify cooler air moving in from the north and northwest . Coastal waters temperatures around the years are about 75 ° F ( 24 ° C ) in February to 85 ° F ( 29 ° C ) in August . The highest temperature ever recorded was 99 ° F ( 37 ° C ) at Arecibo , while the lowest temperature ever recorded was 40 ° F ( 4 ° C ) in the mountains at Adjuntas , Aibonito , and Corozal . The average yearly precipitation is 1,687 mm ( 66 in ) .

The Weather Channel . Retrieved March 22 , 2014 . Puerto Rico experiences the Atlantic hurricane season , similar to the remainder of the Caribbean Sea and North Atlantic oceans . On average , a quarter of its annual rainfall is contributed from tropical cyclones , which are more prevalent during periods of La Niña than El Niño . A cyclone of tropical storm strength passes near Puerto Rico , on average , every five years . A hurricane passes in the vicinity of the island , on average , every seven years . Since 1851 , the Lake Okeechobee Hurricane of September 1928 is the only hurricane to make landfall as a Category 5 hurricane . In the busy 2017 Atlantic hurricane season , Puerto Rico avoided a direct hit by the Category 5 Hurricane Irma on September 8 , 2017 , but high winds caused a loss of electrical power to some one million residents . Almost 50 % of hospitals were operating with power provided by generators . The Category 4 Hurricane Jose , as expected , veered away from Puerto Rico . A short time later , the devastating Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane , with sustained 155 mph ( 249 km / h ) winds , powerful rains and widespread flooding causing tremendous destruction , including the electrical grid , which could remain out for 4 -- 6 months . With such widespread destruction and a great need for supplies -- everything from drinking water , food , medicine and personal care items to fuel for generators and construction materials for rebuilding the island -- Gov. Rossello and several Congressmen called on the federal government to waive the WWI - era Jones Act ( protectionist provisions : ships made and owned in U.S. , and with U.S. crews ) , which essentially double Puerto Rico 's cost for shipped goods relative to neighboring islands . On September 28 , U.S. President Donald Trump waived the Act for ten days . Biodiversity Main articles : Fauna of Puerto Rico and Flora of Puerto Rico Common Coquí Species endemic to the archipelago number 239 plants , 16 birds and 39 amphibians / reptiles , recognized as of 1998 . Most of these ( 234 , 12 and 33 respectively ) are found on the main island . The most recognizable endemic species and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride is the coquí , a small frog easily identified by the sound of its call , from which it gets its name . Most coquí species ( 13 of 17 ) live in the El Yunque National Forest , a tropical rainforest in the northeast of the island previously known as the Caribbean National Forest . El Yunque is home to more than 240 plants , 26 of which are endemic to the island . It is also home to 50 bird species , including the critically endangered Puerto Rican amazon . Across the island in the southwest , the 40 km ( 15 sq mi ) of dry land at the Guánica Commonwealth Forest Reserve contain over 600 uncommon species of plants and animals , including 48 endangered species and 16 endemic to Puerto Rico .

From 2000 to 2010 , the population decreased , the first such decrease in census history for Puerto Rico . It went from the 3,808,610 residents registered in the 2000 Census to 3,725,789 in the 2010 Census . A declining and aging population presents additional problems for the society . The U.S. Census Bureau 's estimate for July 1 , 2016 was 3,411,307 people , down substantially from the 2010 data which had indicated 3,725,789 people . Continuous European immigration and high natural increase helped the population of Puerto Rico grow from 155,426 in 1800 , to almost a million by the close of the 19th century . A census conducted by royal decree on September 30 , 1858 , gave the following totals of the Puerto Rican population at that time : 341,015 were Free colored ; 300,430 identified as Whites ; and 41,736 were slaves . During the 19th century hundreds of families arrived in Puerto Rico , primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia , but also from other parts of Spain such as Catalonia , Asturias , Galicia and the Balearic Islands and numerous Spanish loyalists from Spain 's former colonies in South America . Settlers from outside Spain also arrived in the islands , including from Corsica , France , Lebanon , China , Portugal , Ireland , Scotland , Germany and Italy . This immigration from non-Hispanic countries was the result of the Real Cedula de Gracias de 1815 ( `` Royal Decree of Graces of 1815 '' ) , which allowed European Catholics to settle in the island with land allotments in the interior of the island , provided they paid taxes and continued to support the Catholic Church . Racial and Ethnic Composition in Puerto Rico ( 2015 Census est . ) Ethnicity White 75.8 % Black or African American 12.4 % Asian 0.2 % Two or more races 3.3 % American Indian 0.5 % Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander 0.1 % Other races 7.8 % Between 1960 and 1990 the census questionnaire in Puerto Rico did not ask about race or ethnicity . The 2000 United States Census included a racial self - identification question in Puerto Rico . According to the census , most Puerto Ricans identified as White and Hispanic ; few identified as Black or some other race . Population genetics A recent population genetics study conducted in Puerto Rico suggests that between 52.6 % and 84 % of the population possess some degree of Amerindian mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) in their maternal ancestry , usually in a combination with other ancestries such as aboriginal Guanche North - West African ancestry brought by Spanish settlers from the Canary Islands . In addition , these DNA studies show Amerindian ancestry in addition to the Taíno . One genetic study on the racial makeup of Puerto Ricans ( including all races ) found them to be roughly around 61 % West Eurasian / North African ( overwhelmingly of Spanish provenance ) , 27 % Sub-Saharan African and 11 % Native American . Another genetic study from 2007 , claimed that `` the average genomewide individual ( ie . Puerto Rican ) ancestry proportions have been estimated as 66 % , 18 % , and 16 % , for European , West African , and Native American , respectively . '' Other study estimates 63.7 % European , 21.2 % ( Sub-Saharan ) African , and 15.2 % Native American ; European ancestry is more prevalent in the West and in Central Puerto Rico , African in Eastern Puerto Rico , and Native American in Northern Puerto Rico . A Pew Research survey indicated a literacy rate of 90.4 % ( adult population ) in 2012 based on data from the United Nations and a life expectancy of 79.3 years . Immigration and emigration Racial groups Year Population White Mixed ( mainly biracial white European and black African ) Black Asian Other 2000 3,808,610 80.5 % ( 3 064 862 ) 11.0 % ( 418 426 ) 8.0 % ( 302 933 ) 0.2 % ( 7 960 ) 0.4 % ( 14 429 ) 3,725,789 75.8 % ( ' 2 824 148 ) 11.1 % ( ' 413 563 ) 12.4 % ( ' 461 998 ) 0.2 % ( ' 7 452 ) 0.6 % ( ' 22 355 ) Puerto Rico has recently become the permanent home of over 100,000 legal residents . The vast majority of recent immigrants , both legal and illegal , come from the Dominican Republic and Haiti . Other sources sending in significant numbers of recent immigrants include Cuba , Mexico , Colombia , Panama , Jamaica , Venezuela , Spain , and Nigeria . Also , there are many non-Puerto Rican U.S. citizens settling in Puerto Rico , from the mainland United States and the U.S. Virgin Islands , as well as Nuyoricans ( stateside Puerto Ricans ) coming back to Puerto Rico . Most recent immigrants settle in and around San Juan . Emigration is a major part of contemporary Puerto Rican history . Starting soon after World War II , poverty , cheap airfares , and promotion by the island government caused waves of Puerto Ricans to move to the United States , particularly to the Northeastern states , and Florida . This trend continued even as Puerto Rico 's economy improved and its birth rate declined . Puerto Ricans continue to follow a pattern of `` circular migration '' , with some migrants returning to the island . In recent years , the population has declined markedly , falling nearly 1 % in 2012 and an additional 1 % ( 36,000 people ) in 2013 due to a falling birthrate and emigration . According to the 2010 Census , the number of Puerto Ricans living in the United States outside of Puerto Rico far exceeds those living in Puerto Rico . Emigration exceeds immigration . As those who leave tend to be better educated than those that remain , this accentuates the drain on Puerto Rico 's economy . Based on the July 1 , 2016 estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau , the population of the Commonwealth had declined by 314,482 people since the 2010 Census data had been tabulated . Population distribution The most populous city is the capital , San Juan , with approximately 371,400 people based on a 2015 estimate by the Census Bureau . Other major cities include Bayamón , Carolina , Ponce , and Caguas . Of the ten most populous cities on the island , eight are located within what is considered San Juan 's metropolitan area , while the other two are located in the south ( Ponce ) and west ( Mayagüez ) of the island .

Spanish is , and has been , the only official language of the entire Commonwealth judiciary system , despite a 1902 English - only language law . However , all official business of the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico is conducted in English . English is the primary language of less than 10 % of the population . Spanish is the dominant language of business , education and daily life on the island , spoken by nearly 95 % of the population . The U.S. Census Bureau 's 2015 update provides the following facts : 94.1 % of adults speak Spanish , 5.8 % speak only English , 78.3 % do not speak English `` very well '' . In Puerto Rico , public school instruction is conducted almost entirely in Spanish . There have been pilot programs in about a dozen of the over 1,400 public schools aimed at conducting instruction in English only . Objections from teaching staff are common , perhaps because many of them are not fully fluent in English . English is taught as a second language and is a compulsory subject from elementary levels to high school . The languages of the deaf community are American Sign Language and its local variant , Puerto Rican Sign Language . The Spanish of Puerto Rico has evolved into having many idiosyncrasies in vocabulary and syntax that differentiate it from the Spanish spoken elsewhere . As a product of Puerto Rican history , the island possesses a unique Spanish dialect . Puerto Rican Spanish utilizes many Taíno words , as well as English words . The largest influence on the Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico is that of the Canary Islands . The Spanish of Puerto Rico also includes Taíno words , typically in the context of vegetation , natural phenomena or primitive musical instruments . Similarly , words attributed to primarily West African languages were adopted in the contexts of foods , music or dances , particularly in coastal towns with concentrations of descendants of Sub-Saharan Africans . Religion Religious Affiliation ( 2014 ) Roman Catholic ( 56 % ) Protestant ( 33 % ) Other ( 3 % ) Irreligious ( 8 % ) The Roman Catholic Church was brought by Spanish colonists and gradually became the dominant religion in Puerto Rico . The first dioceses in the Americas , including that of Puerto Rico , were authorized by Pope Julius II in 1511 . One Pope , John Paul II , visited Puerto Rico in October 1984 . All municipalities in Puerto Rico have at least one Catholic Church , most of which are located at the town center or `` plaza '' . African slaves brought and maintained various ethnic African religious practices associated with different peoples ; in particular , the Yoruba beliefs of Santería and / or Ifá , and the Kongo - derived Palo Mayombe . Some aspects were absorbed into syncretic Christianity . Protestantism , which was suppressed under the Spanish Catholic regime , has slightly reemerged under United States rule , making contemporary Puerto Rico more interconfessional than in previous centuries , although Catholicism continues to be the dominant religion . The first Protestant church , Iglesia de la Santísima Trinidad , was established in Ponce by the Anglican Diocese of Antigua in 1872 . It was the first non-Roman Catholic Church in the entire Spanish Empire in the Americas . Pollster Pablo Ramos stated in 1998 that the population was 38 % Roman Catholic , 28 % Pentecostal , and 18 % were members of independent churches , which would give a Protestant percentage of 46 % if the last two populations are combined . Protestants collectively added up to almost two million people . Another researcher gave a more conservative assessment of the proportion of Protestants : Puerto Rico , by virtue of its long political association with the United States , is the most Protestant of Latin American countries , with a Protestant population of approximately 33 to 38 percent , the majority of whom are Pentecostal . David Stoll calculates that if we extrapolate the growth rates of evangelical churches from 1960 -- 1985 for another twenty - five years Puerto Rico will become 75 percent evangelical . ( Ana Adams : `` Brincando el Charco ... '' in Power , Politics and Pentecostals in Latin America , Edward Cleary , ed. , 1997 . p. 164 ) . The data provided for 2014 by Pew Research Center , is summarized in the chart to the right . An Associated Press article in March 2014 stated that `` more than 70 percent of whom identify themselves as Catholic '' but provided no source for this information . The CIA World Factbook reports that 85 % of the population of Puerto Rico identifies as Roman Catholic , while 15 % identify as Protestant and Other . Neither a date or a source for that information is provided and may not be recent . A 2013 Pew Research survey found that only about 45 % of Puerto Rican adults identified themselves as Catholic , 29 % as Protestant and 20 % as unaffiliated with a religion . The people surveyed by Pew consisted of Puerto Ricans living in the 50 states and DC and may not be indicative of those living in the Commonwealth . By 2014 , a Pew Research report , with the sub-title Widespread Change in a Historically Catholic Region , indicated that only 56 % of Puerto Ricans were Catholic and that 33 % were Protestant ; this survey was completed between October 2013 and February 2014 . An Eastern Orthodox community , the Dormition of the Most Holy Theotokos / St. Spyridon 's Church is located in Trujillo Alto , and serves the small Orthodox community . This affiliation accounted for under 1 % of the population in 2010 according to the Pew Research report . In 1940 , Juanita García Peraza founded the Mita Congregation , the first religion of Puerto Rican origin . Taíno religious practices have been rediscovered / reinvented to a degree by a handful of advocates . Similarly , some aspects of African religious traditions have been kept by some adherents . In 1952 , a handful of American Jews established the island 's first synagogue ; this religion accounts for under 1 % of the population in 2010 according to the Pew Research report . The synagogue , called Sha'are Zedeck , hired its first rabbi in 1954 . Puerto Rico has the largest Jewish community in the Caribbean , numbering 3000 people ( date not stated ) , and is the only Caribbean island in which the Conservative , Reform and Orthodox Jewish movements all are represented . In 2007 , there were about 5,000 Muslims in Puerto Rico , representing about 0.13 % of the population . Eight mosques are located throughout the island , with most Muslims living in Río Piedras and Caguas , most of these Muslims are of Palestinian and Jordanian descent . In 2015 , the 25,832 Jehovah 's Witnesses represented about 0.70 % of the population , with 324 congregations . The Padmasambhava Buddhist Center , whose followers practice Tibetan Buddhism , has a branch in Puerto Rico . Roman Catholic Cathedral of San Juan Bautista . Anglican Iglesia Santísima Trinidad in Ponce Islamic Center at Ponce Inside Sha'are Zedeck in San Juan Government Main articles : Government of Puerto Rico and Politics of Puerto Rico Puerto Rico has 8 senatorial districts , 40 representative districts and 78 municipalities . It has a republican form of government with separation of powers subject to the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United States . Its current powers are all delegated by the United States Congress and lack full protection under the United States Constitution . Puerto Rico 's head of state is the President of the United States . The government of Puerto Rico , based on the formal republican system , is composed of three branches : the executive , legislative , and judicial branch . The executive branch is headed by the governor , currently Ricky Rosselló . The legislative branch consists of a bicameral legislature called the Legislative Assembly , made up of a Senate as its upper chamber and a House of Representatives as its lower chamber . The Senate is headed by the President of the Senate , currently Thomas Rivera Schatz , while the House of Representatives is headed by the Speaker of the House , currently Johnny Méndez . The governor and legislators are elected by popular vote every four years with the last election held in November 2016 . The judicial branch is headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico , currently Maite Oronoz Rodríguez . Members of the judicial branch are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate . Puerto Rico is represented in the United States Congress by a nonvoting delegate , the Resident Commissioner , currently Jenniffer González . Current congressional rules have removed the Commissioner 's power to vote in the Committee of the Whole , but the Commissioner can vote in committee . Puerto Rican elections are governed by the Federal Election Commission and the State Elections Commission of Puerto Rico . While residing in Puerto Rico , Puerto Ricans can not vote in U.S. presidential elections , but they can vote in primaries . Puerto Ricans who become residents of a U.S. state can vote in presidential elections . Puerto Rico hosts consulates from 41 countries , mainly from the Americas and Europe , with most located in San Juan . As an unincorporated territory of the United States , Puerto Rico does not have any first - order administrative divisions as defined by the U.S. government , but has 78 municipalities at the second level . Mona Island is not a municipality , but part of the municipality of Mayagüez . Municipalities are subdivided into wards or barrios , and those into sectors . Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected for a four - year term . The municipality of San Juan ( previously called `` town '' ) , was founded first , in 1521 , San Germán in 1570 , Coamo in 1579 , Arecibo in 1614 , Aguada in 1692 and Ponce in 1692 . An increase of settlement saw the founding of 30 municipalities in the 18th century and 34 in the 19th . Six were founded in the 20th century ; the last was Florida in 1971 . Political parties and elections Main article : Political party strength in Puerto Rico The difference between the incumbent party , the PPD , and its opponent , the PNP , was a mere 0.6 % in the last election . This difference is common as the political landscape experiences political cycles between both parties , with the PPD ruling all branches of government for 36 of the past 64 years . The PNP , on the other hand , has ruled both the executive and legislative branch concurrently for 16 years . The other 12 years experienced a divided government . Since 1952 , Puerto Rico has had three main political parties : the Popular Democratic Party ( PPD in Spanish ) , the New Progressive Party ( PNP in Spanish ) and the Puerto Rican Independence Party ( PIP ) . The three parties stand for different political status . The PPD , for example , seeks to maintain the island 's status with the U.S. as a commonwealth , while the PNP , on the other hand , seeks to make Puerto Rico a state of the United States . The PIP , in contrast , seeks a complete separation from the United States by seeking to make Puerto Rico a sovereign nation . In terms of party strength , the PPD and PNP usually hold about 47 % of the vote each while the PIP holds only about 5 % . After 2007 , other parties emerged on the island . The first , the Puerto Ricans for Puerto Rico Party ( PPR in Spanish ) was registered that same year . The party claims that it seeks to address the islands ' problems from a status - neutral platform . But it ceased to remain as a registered party when it failed to obtain the required number of votes in the 2008 general election . Four years later , the 2012 election saw the emergence of the Movimiento Unión Soberanista ( MUS ; English : Sovereign Union Movement ) and the Partido del Pueblo Trabajador ( PPT ; English : Working People 's Party ) but none obtained more than 1 % of the vote . Other non-registered parties include the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party , the Socialist Workers Movement , and the Hostosian National Independence Movement . Law Main articles : Constitution of Puerto Rico and Law of Puerto Rico The insular legal system is a blend of civil law and the common law systems . Puerto Rico is the only current U.S. possession whose legal system operates primarily in a language other than American English : namely , Spanish . Because the U.S. federal government operates primarily in English , all Puerto Rican attorneys must be bilingual in order to litigate in English in U.S. federal courts , and litigate federal preemption issues in Puerto Rican courts . Title 48 of the United States Code outlines the role of the United States Code to United States territories and insular areas such as Puerto Rico . After the U.S. government assumed control of Puerto Rico in 1901 , it initiated legal reforms resulting in the adoption of codes of criminal law , criminal procedure , and civil procedure modeled after those then in effect in California . Although Puerto Rico has since followed the federal example of transferring criminal and civil procedure from statutory law to rules promulgated by the judiciary , several portions of its criminal law still reflect the influence of the California Penal Code . The judicial branch is headed by the Chief Justice of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court , which is the only appellate court required by the Constitution . All other courts are created by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico . There is also a Federal District Court for Puerto Rico . Someone accused of a criminal act at the federal level may not be accused for the same act in a Commonwealth court , unlike a state court , since Puerto Rico as a territory lacks sovereignty separate from Congress as a state does . Such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy . Political status Main articles : Political status of Puerto Rico and Proposed political status for Puerto Rico The nature of Puerto Rico 's political relationship with the U.S. is the subject of ongoing debate in Puerto Rico , the United States Congress , and the United Nations . Specifically , the basic question is whether Puerto Rico should remain a U.S. territory , become a U.S. state , or become an independent country . Within the United States The Capitol of Puerto Rico , home of the Legislative Assembly in Puerto Rico Constitutionally , Puerto Rico is subject to the plenary powers of the United States Congress under the territorial clause of Article IV of the U.S. Constitution . Laws enacted at the federal level in the United States apply to Puerto Rico as well , regardless of its political status . Their residents do not have voting representation in the U.S. Congress . Like the different states of the United States , Puerto Rico lacks `` the full sovereignty of an independent nation '' , for example , the power to manage its `` external relations with other nations '' , which is held by the U.S. federal government . The Supreme Court of the United States has indicated that once the U.S. Constitution has been extended to an area ( by Congress or the courts ) , its coverage is irrevocable . To hold that the political branches may switch the Constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they , not this Court , say `` what the law is '' . Puerto Ricans `` were collectively made U.S. citizens '' in 1917 as a result of the Jones - Shafroth Act . U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico can not vote for the U.S. president , though both major parties , Republican and Democratic , run primary elections in Puerto Rico to send delegates to vote on a presidential candidate . Since Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory ( see above ) and not a U.S. state , the United States Constitution does not fully enfranchise U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico . Only fundamental rights under the American federal constitution and adjudications are applied to Puerto Ricans . Various other U.S. Supreme Court decisions have held which rights apply in Puerto Rico and which ones do not . Puerto Ricans have a long history of service in the U.S. Armed Forces and , since 1917 , they have been included in the U.S. compulsory draft whensoever it has been in effect . Though the Commonwealth government has its own tax laws , Puerto Ricans are also required to pay many kinds of U.S. federal taxes , not including the federal personal income tax for Puerto Rico - sourced income , but only under certain circumstances . In 2009 , Puerto Rico paid $3.742 billion into the U.S. Treasury . Residents of Puerto Rico pay into Social Security , and are thus eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement . They are excluded from the Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) , and the island actually receives a smaller fraction of the Medicaid funding it would receive if it were a U.S. state . Also , Medicare providers receive less - than - full state - like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in Puerto Rico , even though the latter paid fully into the system . While a state may try an individual for the same crime he / she was tried in federal court , this is not the case in Puerto Rico . Being a U.S. territory , Puerto Rico 's authority to enact a criminal code derives from Congress and not from local sovereignty as with the states . Thus , such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy and is constitutionally impermissible . In 1992 , President George H.W. Bush issued a memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies establishing the current administrative relationship between the federal government and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico . This memorandum directs all federal departments , agencies , and officials to treat Puerto Rico administratively as if it were a state , insofar as doing so would not disrupt federal programs or operations . Many federal executive branch agencies have significant presence in Puerto Rico , just as in any state , including the Federal Bureau of Investigation , Federal Emergency Management Agency , Transportation Security Administration , Social Security Administration , and others . While Puerto Rico has its own Commonwealth judicial system similar to that of a U.S. state , there is also a U.S. federal district court in Puerto Rico , and Puerto Ricans have served as judges in that Court and in other federal courts on the U.S. mainland regardless of their residency status at the time of their appointment . Sonia Sotomayor , a New Yorker of Puerto Rican descent , serves as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States . Puerto Ricans have also been frequently appointed to high - level federal positions , including serving as United States Ambassadors to other nations . Foreign and intergovernmental relations This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( November 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Main article : Foreign and intergovernmental relations of Puerto Rico Puerto Rico is subject to the Commerce and Territorial Clause of the Constitution of the United States and , therefore , is restricted on how it can engage with other nations , sharing the opportunities and limitations that state governments have albeit not being one . As is the case with state governments , regardless , it has established several trade agreements with other nations , particularly with Hispanic American countries such as Colombia and Panamá . It has also established trade promotion offices in many foreign countries , all Spanish - speaking , and within the United States itself , which now include Spain , the Dominican Republic , Panama , Colombia , Washington , D.C. , New York City and Florida , and has included in the past offices in Chile , Costa Rica , and Mexico . Such agreements require permission from the U.S. Department of State ; most , are simply allowed by existing laws or trade treaties between the United States and other nations which supersede trade agreements pursued by Puerto Rico and different U.S. states . At the local level , Puerto Rico established by law that the international relations which states and territories are allowed to engage must be handled by the Department of State of Puerto Rico , an executive department , headed by the Secretary of State of Puerto Rico , who also serves as the territory 's lieutenant governor . It is also charged to liaise with general consuls and honorary consuls based in Puerto Rico . The Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration , along with the Office of the Resident Commissioner , manage all its intergovernmental affairs before entities of or in the United States ( including the federal government of the United States , local and state governments of the United States , and public or private entities in the United States ) . Both entities frequently assist the Department of State of Puerto Rico in engaging with Washington , D.C. - based ambassadors and federal agencies that handle Puerto Rico 's foreign affairs , such as the U.S. Department of State , the Agency for International Development , and others . The current Secretary of State is Víctor Suárez Meléndez from the Popular Democratic Party and member of the Democratic Party of the United States , while the current Director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration is Juan Eugenio Hernández Mayoral also from the Popular Democratic and member of the Democratic Party . The Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico , the delegate elected by Puerto Ricans to represent them before the federal government , including the U.S. Congress , sits in the United States House of Representatives , serves and votes on congressional committees , and functions in every respect as a legislator except being denied a vote on the final disposition of legislation on the House floor , also engages in foreign affairs to the same extent as other members of Congress . The current Resident Commissioner is Pedro Pierluisi from the New Progressive Party and member of the Democratic Party of the United States . Many Puerto Ricans have served as United States ambassadors to different nations and international organizations , such as the Organization of American States , mostly but not exclusively in Latin America . For example , Maricarmen Aponte , a Puerto Rican and now an Acting Assistant Secretary of State , previously served as U.S. ambassador to El Salvador . Military Main article : Military of Puerto Rico As it is a territory of the United States of America , the defense of Puerto Rico is provided by the United States as part of the Treaty of Paris with the President of the United States as its commander - in - chief . Puerto Rico has its own Puerto Rico National Guard , and its own state defense force , the Puerto Rico State Guard , which by local law is under the authority of the Puerto Rico National Guard . The commander - in - chief of both local forces is the governor of Puerto Rico who delegates his authority to the Puerto Rico Adjutant General , currently Brigadier General Isabelo Rivera . The Adjutant General , in turn , delegates the authority over the State Guard to another officer but retains the authority over the Puerto Rico National Guard as a whole . U.S. military installations in Puerto Rico ( including the United States Virgin Islands ) throughout the 20th century U.S. military installations in Puerto Rico were part of the U.S. Atlantic Command ( LANTCOM after 1993 USACOM ) , which had authority over all U.S. military operations that took place throughout the Atlantic . Puerto Rico had been seen as crucial in supporting LANTCOM 's mission until 1999 , when U.S. Atlantic Command was renamed and given a new mission as United States Joint Forces Command . Puerto Rico is currently under the responsibility of United States Northern Command . Both the Naval Forces Caribbean ( NFC ) and the Fleet Air Caribbean ( FAIR ) were formerly based at the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station . The NFC had authority over all U.S. Naval activity in the waters of the Caribbean while FAIR had authority over all U.S. military flights and air operations over the Caribbean . With the closing of the Roosevelt Roads and Vieques Island training facilities , the U.S. Navy has basically exited from Puerto Rico , except for the ships that steam by , and the only significant military presence in the island is the U.S. Army at Ft Buchanan , the Puerto Rican Army and Air National Guards , and the U.S. Coast Guard . Protests over the noise of bombing practice forced the closure of the naval base . This resulted in a loss of 6,000 jobs and an annual decrease in local income of $300 million . A branch of the U.S. Army National Guard is stationed in Puerto Rico -- known as the Puerto Rico Army National Guard -- which performs missions equivalent to those of the Army National Guards of the different states of the United States , including ground defense , disaster relief , and control of civil unrest . The local National Guard also incorporates a branch of the U.S. Air National Guard -- known as the Puerto Rico Air National Guard -- which performs missions equivalent to those of the Air National Guards of each one of the U.S. states . Ohio - class ballistic missile submarine USS Maryland , Roosevelt Roads Naval Station , 1997 At different times in the 20th century , the U.S. had about 25 military or naval installations in Puerto Rico , some very small ones , as well as large installations . The largest of these installations were the former Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Ceiba , the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility ( AFWTF ) on Vieques , the National Guard training facility at Camp Santiago in Salinas , Fort Allen in Juana Diaz , the Army 's Fort Buchanan in San Juan , the former U.S. Air Force Ramey Air Force Base in Aguadilla , and the Puerto Rico Air National Guard at Muñiz Air Force base in San Juan . The former U.S. Navy facilities at Roosevelt Roads , Vieques , and Sabana Seca have been deactivated and partially turned over to the local government . Other than U.S. Coast Guard and Puerto Rico National Guard facilities , there are only two remaining military installations in Puerto Rico : the U.S. Army 's small Ft. Buchanan ( supporting local veterans and reserve units ) and the PRANG ( Puerto Rico Air National Guard ) Muñiz Air Base ( the C - 130 Fleet ) . In recent years , the U.S. Congress has considered their deactivations , but these have been opposed by diverse public and private entities in Puerto Rico -- such as retired military who rely on Ft. Buchanan for the services available there . Puerto Ricans have participated in many of the military conflicts in which the United States has been involved . For example , they participated in the American Revolution , when volunteers from Puerto Rico , Cuba , and Mexico fought the British in 1779 under the command of General Bernardo de Gálvez ( 1746 -- 1786 ) , and have continued to participate up to the present - day conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan . A significant number of Puerto Ricans participate as members and work for the U.S. Armed Services , largely as National Guard members and civilian employees . The size of the overall military - related community in Puerto Rico is estimated to be 100,000 individuals . This includes retired personnel . Fort Buchanan has about 4,000 military and civilian personnel . In addition , approximately 17,000 people are members of the Puerto Rico Army and Air National Guards , or the U.S. Reserve forces . Puerto Rican soldiers have served in every U.S. military conflict from World War I to the current military engagement known by the United States and its allies as the War against Terrorism . The 65th Infantry Regiment , nicknamed `` The Borinqueneers '' from the original Taíno name of the island ( Borinquen ) , is a Puerto Rican regiment of the United States Army . The regiment 's motto is Honor et Fidelitas , Latin for Honor and Fidelity . The 65th Infantry Regiment participated in World War I , World War II , the Korean War , and the War on Terror and in 2014 was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal , presented by President Barack Obama , for its heroism during the Korean War . Administrative divisions Main article : Municipalities of Puerto Rico There are no counties , as there are in 48 of the 50 United States . There are 78 municipalities . Municipalities are subdivided into barrios , and those into sectors . Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected to four - year terms . A map of Puerto Rico showing its municipalities Economy Main articles : Economy of Puerto Rico and Puerto Rico government - debt crisis Puerto Rico 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) by economic sector The economy of Puerto Rico is classified as a high income economy by the World Bank and as the most competitive economy in Latin America by the World Economic Forum but Puerto Rico currently has a public debt of $72.204 billion ( equivalent to 103 % of GNP ) , and a government deficit of $2.5 billion . According to World Bank , gross national income per capita of Puerto Rico in 2013 is $23,830 ( PPP , International Dollars ) , ranked as 63rd among all sovereign and dependent territories entities in the world . Its economy is mainly driven by manufacturing ( primarily pharmaceuticals , textiles , petrochemicals and electronics ) followed by the service industry ( primarily finance , insurance , real estate and tourism ) . In recent years , the territory has also become a popular destination for MICE ( meetings , incentives , conferencing , exhibitions ) , with a modern convention centre district overlooking the Port of San Juan . The geography of Puerto Rico and its political status are both determining factors on its economic prosperity , primarily due to its relatively small size as an island ; its lack of natural resources used to produce raw materials , and , consequently , its dependence on imports ; as well as its territorial status with the United States , which controls its foreign policy while exerting trading restrictions , particularly in its shipping industry . Puerto Rico experienced a recession from 2006 to 2011 , interrupted by 4 quarters of economic growth , and entered into recession again in 2013 , following growing fiscal imbalance and the expiration of the IRS Section 936 corporate incentives that the U.S. Internal Revenue Code had applied to Puerto Rico . This IRS section was critical to the economy , as it established tax exemptions for U.S. corporations that settled in Puerto Rico , and allowed their insular subsidiaries to send their earnings to the parent corporation at any time , without paying federal tax on corporate income . Puerto Rico has surprisingly been able to maintain a relatively low inflation in the past decade while maintaining a purchasing power parity per capita higher than 80 % of the rest of the world . Academically , most of Puerto Rico 's economic woes stem from federal regulations that expired , have been repealed , or no longer apply to Puerto Rico ; its inability to become self - sufficient and self - sustainable throughout history ; its highly politicized public policy which tends to change whenever a political party gains power ; as well as its highly inefficient local government which has accrued a public debt equal to 68 % of its gross domestic product throughout time . In comparison to the different states of the United States , Puerto Rico is poorer than Mississippi ( the poorest state of the U.S. ) with 41 % of its population below the poverty line . When compared to Latin America , Puerto Rico has the highest GDP per capita in the region . Its main trading partners are the United States itself , Ireland , and Japan , with most products coming from East Asia , mainly from China , Hong Kong , and Taiwan . At a global scale , Puerto Rico 's dependency on oil for transportation and electricity generation , as well as its dependency on food imports and raw materials , makes Puerto Rico volatile and highly reactive to changes in the world economy and climate . Puerto Rico 's agricultural sector represents less than 1 % of GNP . Heavy debt load In early 2017 , the Puerto Rican government - debt crisis posed serious problems for the government which was saddled with outstanding bond debt that had climbed to $70 billion at a time with a 45 percent poverty rate and 12.4 % unemployment that is more than twice the mainland U.S. average . The debt had been increasing during a decade long recession . The Commonwealth had been defaulting on many debts , including bonds , since 2015 . With debt payments due , the Governor was facing the risk of a government shutdown and failure to fund the managed health care system . `` Without action before April , Puerto Rico 's ability to execute contracts for Fiscal Year 2018 with its managed care organizations will be threatened , thereby putting at risk beginning July 1 , 2017 the health care of up to 900,000 poor U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico '' , according to a letter sent to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human Services . They also said that `` Congress must enact measures recommended by both Republicans and Democrats that fix Puerto Rico 's inequitable health care financing structure and promote sustained economic growth . '' Initially , the oversight board created under PROMESA called for Puerto Rico 's governor Ricardo Rosselló to deliver a fiscal turnaround plan by January 28 . Just before that deadline , the control board gave the Commonwealth government until February 28 to present a fiscal plan ( including negotiations with creditors for restructuring debt ) to solve the problems . A moratorium on lawsuits by debtors was extended to May 31 . It is essential for Puerto Rico to reach restructuring deals to avoid a bankruptcy - like process under PROMESA . An internal survey conducted by the Puerto Rican Economists Association revealed that the majority of Puerto Rican economists reject the policy recommendations of the Board and the Rosselló government , with more than 80 % of economists arguing in favor of auditing the debt . In early August 2017 , the island 's financial oversight board ( created by PROMESA ) planned to institute two days off without pay per month for government employees , down from the original plan of four days per month ; the latter had been expected to achieve $218 million in savings . Governor Rossello rejected this plan as unjustified and unnecessary . Pension reforms were also discussed including a proposal for a 10 % reduction in benefits to begin addressing the $50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities . Public finances Main articles : Puerto Rico government - debt crisis , Budget of the Government of Puerto Rico , and public debt of Puerto Rico Puerto Rico has an operating budget of about U.S. $9.8 billion with expenses at about $10.4 billion , creating a structural deficit of $775 million ( about 7.9 % of the budget ) . The practice of approving budgets with a structural deficit has been done for 18 consecutive years starting in 2000 . Throughout those years , including present time , all budgets contemplated issuing bonds to cover these projected deficits rather than making structural adjustments . This practice increased Puerto Rico 's cumulative debt , as the government had already been issuing bonds to balance its actual budget for four decades since 1973 . The 2012 Budget of the Government of Puerto Rico Projected deficits added substantial burdens to an already indebted nation which accrued a public debt of $71 B or about 70 % of Puerto Rico 's gross domestic product . This sparked an ongoing government - debt crisis after Puerto Rico 's general obligation bonds were downgraded to speculative non-investment grade ( `` junk status '' ) by three credit rating agencies . In terms of financial control , almost 9.6 % -- or about $1.5 billion -- of Puerto Rico 's central government budget expenses for FY2014 is expected to be spent on debt service . Harsher budget cuts are expected as Puerto Rico must now repay larger chunks of debts in the following years . For practical reasons the budget is divided into two aspects : a `` general budget '' which comprises the assignments funded exclusively by the Department of Treasury of Puerto Rico , and the `` consolidated budget '' which comprises the assignments funded by the general budget , by Puerto Rico 's government - owned corporations , by revenue expected from loans , by the sale of government bonds , by subsidies extended by the federal government of the United States , and by other funds . Both budgets contrast each other drastically , with the consolidated budget being usually thrice the size of the general budget ; currently $29 B and $9.0 B respectively . Almost one out of every four dollars in the consolidated budget comes from U.S. federal subsidies while government - owned corporations compose more than 31 % of the consolidated budget . The critical aspects come from the sale of bonds , which comprise 7 % of the consolidated budget -- a ratio that increased annually due to the government 's inability to prepare a balanced budget in addition to being incapable of generating enough income to cover all its expenses . In particular , the government - owned corporations add a heavy burden to the overall budget and public debt , as none is self - sufficient . For example , in FY2011 the government - owned corporations reported aggregated losses of more than $1.3 B with the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority ( PRHTA ) reporting losses of $409 M , the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority ( PREPA ; the government monopoly that controls all electricity on the island ) reporting losses of $272 M , while the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority ( PRASA ; the government monopoly that controls all water utilities on the island ) reported losses of $112 M . Losses by government - owned corporations have been defrayed through the issuance of bonds compounding more than 40 % of Puerto Rico 's entire public debt today . Holistically , from FY2000 -- FY2010 Puerto Rico 's debt grew at a compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of 9 % while GDP remained stagnant . This has not always provided a long - term solution . In early July 2017 for example , the PREPA power authority was effectively bankrupt after defaulting in a plan to restructure $9 billion in bond debt ; the agency planned to seek Court protection . In terms of protocol , the governor , together with the Puerto Rico Office of Management and Budget ( OGP in Spanish ) , formulates the budget he believes is required to operate all government branches for the ensuing fiscal year . He then submits this formulation as a budget request to the Puerto Rican legislature before July 1 , the date established by law as the beginning of Puerto Rico 's fiscal year . While the constitution establishes that the request must be submitted `` at the beginning of each regular session '' , the request is typically submitted during the first week of May as the regular sessions of the legislature begin in January and it would be impractical to submit a request so far in advance . Once submitted , the budget is then approved by the legislature , typically with amendments , through a joint resolution and is referred back to the governor for his approval . The governor then either approves it or vetoes it . If vetoed the legislature can then either refer it back with amendments for the governor 's approval , or approve it without the governor 's consent by two - thirds of the bodies of each chamber . Once the budget is approved , the Department of Treasury disburses funds to the Office of Management and Budget which in turn disburses the funds to the respective agencies , while the Puerto Rico Government Development Bank ( the government 's intergovernmental bank ) manages all related banking affairs including those related to the government - owned corporations . Cost of living A map of Jones Act carrier routes for Puerto Rico The cost of living in Puerto Rico is high and has increased over the past decade . San Juan 's in particular is higher than Atlanta , Dallas , and Seattle but lower than Boston , Chicago , and New York City . One factor is housing prices which are comparable to Miami and Los Angeles , although property taxes are considerably lower than most places in the United States . Statistics used for cost of living sometimes do not take into account certain costs , such as the high cost of electricity , which has hovered in the 24 ¢ to 30 ¢ range per kilowatt / hour , two to three times the national average , increased travel costs for longer flights , additional shipping fees , and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers `` outside the continental United States '' . While some online stores do offer free shipping on orders to Puerto Rico , many merchants exclude Hawaii , Alaska , Puerto Rico and other United States territories . The household median income is stated as $19,350 and the mean income as $30,463 in the U.S. Census Bureau 's 2015 update . The report also indicates that 45.5 % of individuals are below the poverty level . The median home value in Puerto Rico ranges from U.S. $100,000 to U.S. $214,000 , while the national median home value sits at $119,600 . One of the most cited contributors to the high cost of living in Puerto Rico is the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 , also known as the Jones Act , which prevents foreign - flagged ships from carrying cargo between two American ports , a practice known as cabotage . Because of the Jones Act , foreign ships inbound with goods from Central and South America , Western Europe , and Africa can not stop in Puerto Rico , offload Puerto Rico - bound goods , load mainland - bound Puerto Rico - manufactured goods , and continue to U.S. ports . Instead , they must proceed directly to U.S. ports , where distributors break bulk and send Puerto Rico - bound manufactured goods to Puerto Rico across the ocean by U.S. - flagged ships . The local government of Puerto Rico has requested several times to the U.S. Congress to exclude Puerto Rico from the Jones Act restrictions without success . The most recent measure has been taken by the 17th Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico through R. Conc . del S. 21 . These measures have always received support from all the major local political parties . In 2013 the Government Accountability Office published a report which concluded that `` repealing or amending the Jones Act cabotage law might cut Puerto Rico shipping costs '' and that `` shippers believed that opening the trade to non-U.S. - flag competition could lower costs '' . However , the same GAO report also found that `` ( shippers ) doing business in Puerto Rico that GAO contacted reported that the freight rates are often -- although not always -- lower for foreign carriers going to and from Puerto Rico and foreign locations than the rates shippers pay to ship similar cargo to and from the United States , despite longer distances . Data were not available to allow us to validate the examples given or verify the extent to which this difference occurred . '' Ultimately , the report concluded that `` ( the ) effects of modifying the application of the Jones Act for Puerto Rico are highly uncertain '' for both Puerto Rico and the United States , particularly for the U.S. shipping industry and the military preparedness of the United States . Education Main article : Education in Puerto Rico The first school in Puerto Rico was the Escuela de Gramática ( Grammar School ) . It was established by Bishop Alonso Manso in 1513 , in the area where the Cathedral of San Juan was to be constructed . The school was free of charge and the courses taught were Latin language , literature , history , science , art , philosophy and theology . Education in Puerto Rico is divided in three levels -- Primary ( elementary school grades 1 -- 6 ) , Secondary ( intermediate and high school grades 7 -- 12 ) , and Higher Level ( undergraduate and graduate studies ) . As of 2002 , the literacy rate of the Puerto Rican population was 94.1 % ; by gender , it was 93.9 % for males and 94.4 % for females . According to the 2000 Census , 60.0 % of the population attained a high school degree or higher level of education , and 18.3 % has a bachelor 's degree or higher . Instruction at the primary school level is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 18 . As of 2010 , there are 1539 public schools and 806 private schools . The largest and oldest university system is the public University of Puerto Rico ( UPR ) with 11 campuses . The largest private university systems on the island are the Sistema Universitario Ana G. Mendez which operates the Universidad del Turabo , Metropolitan University and Universidad del Este . Other private universities include the multi-campus Inter American University , the Pontifical Catholic University , Universidad Politécnica de Puerto Rico , and the Universidad del Sagrado Corazón . Puerto Rico has four schools of Medicine and three ABA - approved Law Schools . Public health and safety As of 2015 medical care in Puerto Rico had been heavily impacted by emigration of doctors to the mainland and underfunding of the Medicare and Medicaid programs which serve 60 % of the island 's population . Affordable medical insurance under the Affordable Care Act is not available in Puerto Rico as , since Puerto Ricans pay no income tax , no subsidies are available . The city of San Juan has a system of triage , hospital , and preventive care health services . The municipal government sponsors regular health fairs in different areas of the city focusing on health care for the elderly and the disabled . In 2017 , there were 69 hospitals in Puerto Rico . There are twenty hospitals in San Juan , half of which are operated by the government . The largest hospital is the Centro Médico de Río Piedras ( the Río Piedras Medical Center ) . Founded in 1956 , it is operated by the Medical Services Administration of the Department of Health of Puerto Rico , and is actually a network of eight hospitals : San Juan Municipal Hospital : This hospital is operated by the San Juan municipal government . Industrial Hospital : This is the hospital for Puerto Rico government employees , whether municipal or Commonwealth government employees . Normally , injured police officers and firefighters are cared for here . San Juan Pediatric Hospital -- Also operated by the San Juan municipal government . Pediatric Hospital : Operated by the government of the Commonwealth , this is the main trauma hospital for pediatric cases . Centro Medico Emergency Room : This is the main hospital for trauma cases for Puerto Rico and the Caribbean . Centro Cardiovascular del Caribe ( Caribbean Cardiovascular Center ) : This is the main hospital for open heart surgery in the Caribbean . It features a hotel for the patients ' families . Psychiatric Hospital : The main psychiatric hospital in Puerto Rico . Operated by the government of Puerto Rico . Psychiatric Correctional Hospital : It is both a hospital and correctional facility . It is operated jointly by the Puerto Rico Department of Corrections and the Medical Services Administration . The city of San Juan operates nine other hospitals . Of these , eight are Diagnostic and Treatment Centers located in communities throughout San Juan . These nine hospitals are : La Perla Puerta de Tierra Llorens Torres Puerto Nuevo San José Río Piedras Sabana Llana Hoare Santurce Parada 19 There are also ten private hospitals in San Juan . These are : Hospital Metropilitano Hospital Auxilio Mutuo Hospital Auxilio Mutuo Expreso Hospital de Veteranos : The main Veterans hospital in the Caribbean . Operated by the U.S. Veteran Healthcare System . Ashford Presbyterian Hospital Hospital Pavia Hato Rey Hospital Pavia Santurce San Jorge Children 's Hospital : The most well known children 's hospital in the San Juan Metropolitan Area . Hospital San Gerardo : Located at the Cupey neighborhood , is a small hospital but is also specialized in psychiatry and elderly . Hospital del Maestro ( Teachers Hospital ) : Located in Hato Rey , this hospital is operated by the Puerto Rico Teachers Association . The city of Ponce is served by several clinics and hospitals . There are four comprehensive care hospitals : Hospital Dr. Pila , Hospital San Cristobal , Hospital San Lucas , and Hospital de Damas . In addition , Hospital Oncológico Andrés Grillasca specializes in the treatment of cancer , and Hospital Siquiátrico specializes in mental disorders . There is also a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic that provides health services to U.S. veterans . The U.S. Veterans Administration will build a new hospital in the city to satisfy regional needs . Hospital de Damas is listed in the U.S. News & World Report as one of the best hospitals under the U.S. flag . Ponce has the highest concentration of medical infrastructure per inhabitant of any municipality in Puerto Rico . On the island of Culebra , there is a small hospital in the island called Hospital de Culebra . It also offers pharmacy services to residents and visitors . For emergencies , patients are transported by plane to Fajardo on the main island . The town of Caguas has three hospitals : Hospital Hima San Pablo , Menonita Caguas Regional Hospital , and the San Juan Bautista Medical Center . The town of Cayey is served by the Hospital Menonita de Cayey , and the Hospital Municipal de Cayey . Reforma de Salud de Puerto Rico ( Puerto Rico Health Reform ) -- locally referred to as La Reforma ( The Reform ) -- is a government - run program which provides medical and health care services to the indigent and impoverished , by means of contracting private health insurance companies , rather than employing government - owned hospitals and emergency centers . The Reform is administered by the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration . Crime See also : Illegal drugs in Puerto Rico The overall rate of crime is low in Puerto Rico . The territory has a high firearm homicide rate . The homicide rate of 19.2 per 100,000 inhabitants was significantly higher than any U.S. state in 2014 . Most homicide victims are gang members and drug traffickers with about 80 % of homicides in Puerto Rico being drug related . Culture Main article : Culture of Puerto Rico Modern Puerto Rican culture is a unique mix of cultural antecedents : including European ( predominantly Spanish , Italian , French , German and Irish ) , African , and , more recently , some North American and lots of South Americans . A large number of Cubans and Dominicans have relocated to the island in the past few decades . From the Spanish , Puerto Rico received the Spanish language , the Catholic religion and the vast majority of their cultural and moral values and traditions . The United States added English - language influence , the university system and the adoption of some holidays and practices . On March 12 , 1903 , the University of Puerto Rico was officially founded , branching out from the `` Escuela Normal Industrial '' , a smaller organization that was founded in Fajardo three years before . Much of Puerto Rican culture centers on the influence of music and has been shaped by other cultures combining with local and traditional rhythms . Early in the history of Puerto Rican music , the influences of Spanish and African traditions were most noticeable . The cultural movements across the Caribbean and North America have played a vital role in the more recent musical influences which have reached Puerto Rico . The official symbols of Puerto Rico are the reinita mora or Puerto Rican spindalis ( a type of bird ) , the flor de maga ( a type of flower ) , and the ceiba or kapok ( a type of tree ) . The unofficial animal and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride is the coquí , a small frog . Other popular symbols of Puerto Rico are the jíbaro ( the `` countryman '' ) , and the carite . Architecture Main article : Architecture of Puerto Rico The architecture of Puerto Rico demonstrates a broad variety of traditions , styles and national influences accumulated over four centuries of Spanish rule , and a century of American rule . Spanish colonial architecture , Ibero - Islamic , art deco , post-modern , and many other architectural forms are visible throughout the island . From town to town , there are also many regional distinctions . Old San Juan Old San Juan is one of the two barrios , in addition to Santurce , that made up the municipality of San Juan from 1864 to 1951 , at which time the former independent municipality of Río Piedras was annexed . With its abundance of shops , historic places , museums , open air cafés , restaurants , gracious homes , tree - shaded plazas , and its old beauty and architectonical peculiarity , Old San Juan is a main spot for local and internal tourism . The district is also characterized by numerous public plazas and churches including San José Church and the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista , which contains the tomb of the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León . It also houses the oldest Catholic school for elementary education in Puerto Rico , the Colegio de Párvulos , built in 1865 . The oldest parts of the district of Old San Juan remain partly enclosed by massive walls . Several defensive structures and notable forts , such as the emblematic Fort San Felipe del Morro , Fort San Cristóbal , and El Palacio de Santa Catalina , also known as La Fortaleza , acted as the primary defenses of the settlement which was subjected to numerous attacks . La Fortaleza continues to serve also as the executive mansion for the Governor of Puerto Rico . Many of the historic fortifications are part of San Juan National Historic Site . During the 1940s , sections of Old San Juan fell into disrepair , and many renovation plans were suggested . There was even a strong push to develop Old San Juan as a `` small Manhattan '' . Strict remodeling codes were implemented to prevent new constructions from affecting the common colonial Spanish architectural themes of the old city . When a project proposal suggested that the old Carmelite Convent in San Juan be demolished to erect a new hotel , the Institute had the building declared as a historic building , and then asked that it be converted to a hotel in a renewed facility . This was what became the Hotel El Convento in Old San Juan . The paradigm to reconstruct and renovate the old city and revitalize it has been followed by other cities in the Americas , particularly Havana , Lima and Cartagena de Indias . Ponce Creole is an architectural style created in Ponce , Puerto Rico , in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . This style of Puerto Rican buildings is found predominantly in residential homes in Ponce that developed between 1895 and 1920 . Ponce Creole architecture borrows heavily from the traditions of the French , the Spaniards , and the Caribbean to create houses that were especially built to withstand the hot and dry climate of the region , and to take advantage of the sun and sea breezes characteristic of the southern Puerto Rico 's Caribbean Sea coast . It is a blend of wood and masonry , incorporating architectural elements of other styles , from Classical revival and Spanish Revival to Victorian . Arts Main article : Puerto Rican art Puerto Rican art reflects many influences , much from its ethnically diverse background . A form of folk art , called santos evolved from the Catholic Church 's use of sculptures to convert indigenous Puerto Ricans to Christianity . Santos depict figures of saints and other religious icons and are made from native wood , clay , and stone . After shaping simple , they are often finished by painting them in vivid colors . Santos vary in size , with the smallest examples around eight inches tall and the largest about twenty inches tall . Traditionally , santos were seen as messengers between the earth and Heaven . As such , they occupied a special place on household altars , where people prayed to them , asked for help , or tried to summon their protection . Also popular , caretas or vejigantes are masks worn during carnivals . Similar masks signifying evil spirits were used in both Spain and Africa , though for different purposes . The Spanish used their masks to frighten lapsed Christians into returning to the church , while tribal Africans used them as protection from the evil spirits they represented . True to their historic origins Puerto Rican caretas always bear at least several horns and fangs . While usually constructed of papier - mâché , coconut shells and fine metal screening are sometimes used as well . Red and black were the typical colors for caretas but their palette has expanded to include a wide variety of bright hues and patterns . Literature Main article : Puerto Rican literature Eugenio María de Hostos Puerto Rican literature evolved from the art of oral story telling to its present - day status . Written works by the native islanders of Puerto Rico were prohibited and repressed by the Spanish colonial government . Only those who were commissioned by the Spanish Crown to document the chronological history of the island were allowed to write . Diego de Torres Vargas was allowed to circumvent this strict prohibition for three reasons : he was a priest , he came from a prosperous Spanish family , and his father was a Sergeant Major in the Spanish Army , who died while defending Puerto Rico from an invasion by the Dutch armada . In 1647 , Torres Vargas wrote Descripción de la Ciudad e Isla de Puerto Rico ( `` Description of the Island and City of Puerto Rico '' ) . This historical book was the first to make a detailed geographic description of the island . The book described all the fruits and commercial establishments of the time , mostly centered in the towns of San Juan and Ponce . The book also listed and described every mine , church , and hospital in the island at the time . The book contained notices on the State and Capital , plus an extensive and erudite bibliography . Descripción de la Ciudad e Isla de Puerto Rico was the first successful attempt at writing a comprehensive history of Puerto Rico . Some of Puerto Rico 's earliest writers were influenced by the teachings of Rafael Cordero . Among these was Dr. Manuel A. Alonso , the first Puerto Rican writer of notable importance . In 1849 he published El Gíbaro , a collection of verses whose main themes were the poor Puerto Rican country farmer . Eugenio María de Hostos wrote La peregrinación de Bayoán in 1863 , which used Bartolomé de las Casas as a spring board to reflect on Caribbean identity . After this first novel , Hostos abandoned fiction in favor of the essay which he saw as offering greater possibilities for inspiring social change . In the late 19th century , with the arrival of the first printing press and the founding of the Royal Academy of Belles Letters , Puerto Rican literature began to flourish . The first writers to express their political views in regard to Spanish colonial rule of the island were journalists . After the United States invaded Puerto Rico during the Spanish -- American War and the island was ceded to the Americans as a condition of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 , writers and poets began to express their opposition to the new colonial rule by writing about patriotic themes . Alejandro Tapia y Rivera , also known as the Father of Puerto Rican Literature , ushered in a new age of historiography with the publication of The Historical Library of Puerto Rico . Cayetano Coll y Toste was another Puerto Rican historian and writer . His work The Indo - Antillano Vocabulary is valuable in understanding the way the Taínos lived . Dr. Manuel Zeno Gandía in 1894 wrote La Charca and told about the harsh life in the remote and mountainous coffee regions in Puerto Rico . Dr. Antonio S. Pedreira , described in his work Insularismo the cultural survival of the Puerto Rican identity after the American invasion . With the Puerto Rican diaspora of the 1940s , Puerto Rican literature was greatly influenced by a phenomenon known as the Nuyorican Movement . Puerto Rican literature continued to flourish and many Puerto Ricans have since distinguished themselves as authors , journalists , poets , novelists , playwrights , screenwriters , essayists and have also stood out in other literary fields . The influence of Puerto Rican literature has transcended the boundaries of the island to the United States and the rest of the world . Over the past fifty years , significant writers include Ed Vega , Luis Rafael Sánchez , Piri Thomas , Giannina Braschi , and Miguel Piñero . Esmeralda Santiago has written an autobiographical trilogy about growing up in modern Puerto Rico as well as an historical novel , Conquistadora , about life on a sugar plantation during the mid-19th century . Media Main article : Media in Puerto Rico The media in Puerto Rico includes local radio stations , television stations and newspapers , the majority of which are conducted in Spanish . There are also three stations of the U.S. Armed Forces Radio and Television Service . Newspapers with daily distribution are El Nuevo Dia , El Vocero and Indice , Metro , and Primera Hora . El Vocero is distributed free of charge as well as Indice and Metro . Newspapers distributed on a weekly or regional basis include Claridad , La Perla del Sur , La Opinion , Vision , and La Estrella del Norte , among others . Several television channels provide local content in the island . These include WIPR - TV , Telemundo , Univision Puerto Rico , WAPA - TV , and WKAQ - TV . Music Main article : Music of Puerto Rico Play media A dancer performs typical bomba choreography . The music of Puerto Rico has evolved as a heterogeneous and dynamic product of diverse cultural resources . The most conspicuous musical sources have been Spain and West Africa , although many aspects of Puerto Rican music reflect origins elsewhere in Europe and the Caribbean and , over the last century , from the U.S. Puerto Rican music culture today comprises a wide and rich variety of genres , ranging from indigenous genres like bomba , plena , aguinaldo , danza and salsa to recent hybrids like reggaeton . Puerto Rico has some national instruments , like the Cuatro ( Spanish for Four ) . The cuatro is a local instrument that was made by the `` Jibaro '' or people from the mountains . Originally , the Cuatro consisted of four steel strings , hence its name , but currently the Cuatro consists of five double steel strings . It is easily confused with a guitar , even by locals . When held upright , from right to left , the strings are G , D , A , E , B . In the realm of classical music , the island hosts two main orchestras , the Orquesta Sinfónica de Puerto Rico and the Orquesta Filarmónica de Puerto Rico . The Casals Festival takes place annually in San Juan , drawing in classical musicians from around the world . With respect to opera , the legendary Puerto Rican tenor Antonio Paoli was so celebrated , that he performed private recitals for Pope Pius X and the Czar Nicholas II of Russia . In 1907 , Paoli was the first operatic artist in world history to record an entire opera -- when he participated in a performance of Pagliacci by Ruggiero Leoncavallo in Milan , Italy . Over the past fifty years , Puerto Rican artists such as Jorge Emmanuelli , Yomo Toro , Ramito , Jose Feliciano , Bobby Capo , Rafael Cortijo , Ismael Rivera , Chayanne , Tito Puente , Eddie Palmieri , Ray Barreto , Dave Valentin , Omar Rodríguez - López , Hector Lavoe , Ricky Martin , Marc Anthony and Luis Fonsi have thrilled audiences around the world . Cuisine Main article : Puerto Rican cuisine Cuchifritos ( Carnitas ) in New York Puerto Rican cuisine has its roots in the cooking traditions and practices of Europe ( Spain ) , Africa and the native Taínos . In the latter part of the 19th century , the cuisine of Puerto Rico was greatly influenced by the United States in the ingredients used in its preparation . Puerto Rican cuisine has transcended the boundaries of the island , and can be found in several countries outside the archipelago . Basic ingredients include grains and legumes , herbs and spices , starchy tropical tubers , vegetables , meat and poultry , seafood and shellfish , and fruits .

The traditional Puerto Rican cuisine was well established by the end of the 19th century . By 1848 the first restaurant , La Mallorquina , opened in Old San Juan . El Cocinero Puertorriqueño , the island 's first cookbook was published in 1849 . Plantain `` arañitas '' and `` tostones rellenos '' From the diet of the Taíno people come many tropical roots and tubers like yautía ( taro ) and especially Yuca ( cassava ) , from which thin cracker - like casabe bread is made .

The Taínos also grew varieties of beans and some maize / corn , but maize was not as dominant in their cooking as it was for the peoples living on the mainland of Mesoamerica . This is due to the frequent hurricanes that Puerto Rico experiences , which destroy crops of maize , leaving more safeguarded plants like conucos ( hills of yuca grown together ) . Spanish / European influence is also seen in Puerto Rican cuisine . Wheat , chickpeas ( garbanzos ) , capers , olives , olive oil , black pepper , onions , garlic , cilantrillo ( cilantro ) , oregano , basil , sugarcane , citrus fruit , eggplant , ham , lard , chicken , beef , pork , and cheese all came to Borikén ( Puerto Rico 's native Taino name ) from Spain . The tradition of cooking complex stews and rice dishes in pots such as rice and beans are also thought to be originally European ( much like Italians , Spaniards , and the British ) . Early Dutch , French , Italian , and Chinese immigrants influenced not only the culture but Puerto Rican cooking as well . This great variety of traditions came together to form La Cocina Criolla . Coconuts , coffee ( brought by the Arabs and Corsos to Yauco from Kafa , Ethiopia ) , okra , yams , sesame seeds , gandules ( pigeon peas in English ) sweet bananas , plantains , other root vegetables and Guinea hen , all come to Puerto Rico from Africa .

Jump up ^ The Spanish word for commonwealth is typically mancomunidad . Jump up ^ In 1932 , the U.S. Congress officially back - corrected the former Anglicization of Porto Rico into the Spanish name Puerto Rico . It had been using the former spelling in its legislative and judicial records since it acquired the territory . Patricia Gherovici states that both `` Porto Rico '' and `` Puerto Rico '' were used interchangeably in the news media and documentation before , during , and after the U.S. conquest of the island in 1898 . The `` Porto '' spelling , for instance , was used in the Treaty of Paris , but `` Puerto '' was used by The New York Times that same year . Nancy Morris clarifies that `` a curious oversight in the drafting of the Foraker Act caused the name of the island to be officially misspelled '' . However , Gervasio Luis Garcia traces the Anglicized spelling to a National Geographic article from 1899 , after which the spelling was kept by many agencies and entities because of the ethnic and linguistic pride of the English - speaking citizens of the American mainland .

With my vote , I make the initial request to the Federal Government to begin the process of the decolonization through : ( 1 ) Free Association : Puerto Rico should adopt a status outside of the Territory Clause of the Constitution of the United States that recognizes the sovereignty of the People of Puerto Rico . The Free Association would be based on a free and voluntary political association , the specific terms of which shall be agreed upon between the United States and Puerto Rico as sovereign nations . Such agreement would provide the scope of the jurisdictional powers that the People of Puerto Rico agree to confer to the United States and retain all other jurisdictional powers and authorities . Under this option the American citizenship would be subject to negotiation with the United States Government ; ( 2 ) Proclamation of Independence , I demand that the United States Government , in the exercise of its power to dispose of territory , recognize the national sovereignty of Puerto Rico as a completely independent nation and that the United States Congress enact the necessary legislation to initiate the negotiation and transition to the independent nation of Puerto Rico . My vote for Independence also represents my claim to the rights , duties , powers , and prerogatives of independent and democratic republics , my support of Puerto Rican citizenship , and a `` Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation '' between Puerto Rico and the United States after the transition process Jump up ^ Wyss , Jim . `` Will Puerto Rico become the newest star on the American flag ?

The Royal Courts of Justice on the Strand in London is the seat of the High Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal . English law is the common law legal system of England and Wales , comprising mainly criminal law and civil law , each branch having its own courts and procedures .

In the absence of any statutory law , the common law with its principle of stare decisis forms the residual source of law , based on judicial decisions , custom , and usage . Its essence is that it is made by sitting judges applying both statutory law and the body of common law principles which have been established over the years from the reasoning of decisions in previous legal cases . A decision of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom , the highest civil appeal court of the United Kingdom , is binding on every other court . Equity is a further source of judge - made law . International treaties such as the European Union 's Treaty of Rome or the Hague - Visby Rules have effect in English law only when adopted and ratified by Act of Parliament . Adopted treaties may be subsequently denounced by executive action . Not being a civil law system , English law has no comprehensive codification . However , most of its criminal law has been codified from its common law origins , in the interests both of certainty and of ease of prosecution . For the time being , murder remains a common law crime rather than a statutory offence . Common law can be amended or repealed by Parliament ; for example section 4 of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 effectively overrules Grant v Norway . Following Montesquieu 's theory of the `` separation of powers '' , only Parliament has the power to legislate ; but in the event of a statute being ambiguous , only the courts have the power to decide its true meaning , using the principles of statutory interpretation . The courts have no authority to legislate , so the `` legal fiction '' is that they `` declare '' ( rather than `` create '' ) the common law . The House of Lords took this `` declaratory power '' a stage further in DPP v Shaw , where , in creating the new crime of `` conspiracy to corrupt public morals '' , Viscount Simonds claimed the court had a `` residual power to protect the moral welfare of the state '' . Although Scotland and Northern Ireland form part of the United Kingdom , they have separate legal systems , although they share Westminster as a primary legislature , and Supreme Court decisions of any UK country is binding on the others , as in Donoghue v Stevenson . Even though Scotland became part of the UK over 300 years ago , Scots law has remained remarkably distinct from English law . Statute law ( edit ) Statutory framework ( edit ) The first schedule of the Interpretation Act 1978 , defines the following terms : `` British Islands '' , `` England '' , and `` United Kingdom '' . The use of the term `` British Isles '' is virtually obsolete in statutes and , when it does appear , it is taken to be synonymous with `` British Islands '' . For interpretation purposes , England includes a number of specified elements : Wales and Berwick Act 1746 , section 3 ( entire Act now repealed ) formally incorporated Wales and Berwick - upon - Tweed into England . But section 4 Welsh Language Act 1967 provided that references to England in future Acts of Parliament should no longer include Wales ( see now Interpretation Act 1978 , Schedule 3 , part 1 ) . But Dicey & Morris say ( at p28 ) `` It seems desirable to adhere to Dicey 's ( the original ) definition for reasons of convenience and especially of brevity . It would be cumbersome to have to add `` or Wales '' after `` England '' and `` or Welsh '' after `` English '' every time those words are used . '' the `` adjacent islands '' of the Isle of Wight and Anglesey are a part of England and Wales by custom , while Harman v Bolt ( 1931 ) 47 TLR 219 expressly confirms that Lundy is a part of England . the `` adjacent territorial waters '' by virtue of the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act 1878 and the Continental Shelf Act 1964 as amended by the Oil and Gas Enterprise Act 1982 . `` Great Britain '' means England , Wales , Scotland , their adjacent territorial waters and the islands of Orkney and Shetland , the Hebrides and , by virtue of the Island of Rockall Act 1972 , Rockall . `` United Kingdom '' means Great Britain and Northern Ireland and their adjacent territorial waters , but not the Isle of Man , nor the Channel Islands , whose independent status was discussed in Rover International Ltd. v Canon Film Sales Ltd. ( 1987 ) 1 WLR 1597 and Chloride Industrial Batteries Ltd. v F. & W. Freight Ltd. ( 1989 ) 1 WLR 823 . `` British Islands '' -- but not `` British Isles '' -- means the United Kingdom , the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands . Types of statute law ( edit ) Acts of the Old Irish Parliament Acts of the Scottish Parliament Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament Measures of the Northern Ireland Assembly Measures of the National Assembly for Wales Acts of the National Assembly for Wales Ministerial Order Northern Ireland Statutory Rules UK Statutory Instruments Citation style ( edit ) Main article : Short title Statutes are cited in this fashion : `` Short Title Year '' , e.g. Theft Act 1968 . By contrast , American convention inserts `` of '' , as in `` Civil Rights Act of 1964 '' . This became the usual way to refer to Acts in the second half of the 19th century , starting in the 1840s ; previously Acts were referred to by their long title together with the regnal year of the parliamentary session in which they received Royal Assent , and the chapter number . For example , the Pleading in English Act 1362 was referred to as 36 Edw . III c. 15 , meaning `` 36th year of the reign of Edward III , chapter 15 '' , though in the past this was all spelt out , together with the long title . Common law ( edit ) Description ( edit ) Common law is a term with historical origins in the legal system of England . It denotes , in the first place , the judge - made law that developed from the early Middle Ages as described in a work published at the end of the 19th century , The History of English Law before the Time of Edward I , in which Pollock and Maitland expanded the work of Coke ( 17th century ) and Blackstone ( 18th century ) . Specifically , the law developed in England 's Court of Common Pleas and other common law courts , which became also the law of the colonies settled initially under the crown of England or , later , of the United Kingdom , in North America and elsewhere ; and this law as further developed after those courts in England were reorganised by the Supreme Court of Judicature Acts passed in the 1870s , and developed independently , in the legal systems of the United States and other jurisdictions , after their independence from the United Kingdom , before and after the 1870s . The term is used , in the second place , to denote the law developed by those courts , in the same periods ( pre-colonial , colonial and post-colonial ) , as distinct from within the jurisdiction , or former jurisdiction , of other courts in England : the Court of Chancery , the ecclesiastical courts , and the Admiralty court . In the Oxford English Dictionary ( 1933 ) `` common law '' is described as `` The unwritten law of England , administered by the King 's courts , which purports to be derived from ancient usage , and is embodied in the older commentaries and the reports of abridged cases '' , as opposed , in that sense , to statute law , and as distinguished from the equity administered by the Chancery and similar courts , and from other systems such as ecclesiasical law , and admiralty law . For usage in the United States the description is `` the body of legal doctrine which is the foundation of the law administered in all states settled from England , and those formed by later settlement or division from them '' . Early development ( edit ) Since 1189 , English law has been described as a common law rather than a civil law system ; in other words , no comprehensive codification of the law has taken place and judicial precedents are binding as opposed to persuasive . This may be a legacy of the Norman conquest of England , when a number of legal concepts and institutions from Norman law were introduced to England . In the early centuries of English common law , the justices and judges were responsible for adapting the system of writs to meet everyday needs , applying a mixture of precedent and common sense to build up a body of internally consistent law . An example is the Law Merchant derived from the `` Pie - Powder '' Courts , named from a corruption of the French pieds - poudrés ( `` dusty feet '' ) implying ad hoc marketplace courts . As the Parliament of England became ever more established and influential , legislation gradually overtook judicial law - making such that today , judges are only able to innovate in certain very narrowly defined areas . In 1276 , the concept of `` time immemorial '' often applied in common law was defined as being any time before 6 July 1189 ( i.e. before Richard I 's accession to the English throne ) . Precedent ( edit ) One of the major challenges in the early centuries was to produce a system that was certain in its operation and predictable in its outcomes . Too many judges were either partial or incompetent , acquiring their positions only by virtue of their rank in society . Thus , a standardised procedure slowly emerged , based on a system termed stare decisis which roughly means `` let the decision stand '' . The doctrine of precedent which requires similar cases to be adjudicated in a like manner , falls under the principle of stare decisis . Thus , the ratio decidendi ( reason for decision ) of each case will bind future cases on the same generic set of facts both horizontally and vertically in the court structure . The highest appellate court in the UK is the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and its decisions are binding on every other court in the hierarchy which are obliged to apply its rulings as the law of the land . The Court of Appeal binds the lower courts , and so on . Overseas influences ( edit ) The influences are two - way . England exported English Common law and English Statute law to most parts of the British Empire , and many aspects of that system have survived after Independence or otherwise cessation of British rule . `` English law '' prior to the American Revolutionary Wars ( American War of Independence ) is still an influence on United States law , and provides the basis for many American legal traditions and policies . Many jurisdictions that have maintained the use of English Common law continue to incorporate modern developments of the Common law in England , and decisions from England are in many jurisdictions usually considered persuasive . The common law as taken or received from England has developed within each jurisdiction , and in that context , `` common law '' has been described as a body of judge - made law enforced and developed by the courts which includes equity and admiralty law , but has always been `` unintelligible without reference to statute '' . After the colonial period , the common law was developed within each jurisdiction under its final court of appeal : for a time in jurisdictions remaining under the British crown , it was the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council , while from the founding of the United States each state has its own supreme court with final appellate jurisdiction , and in respect of federal law the US Supreme Court has the final appellate jurisdiction . For a number of jurisdictions within the Commonwealth of Nations , the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Britain remains the ultimate court of appeal in place of a local Supreme Court . The decisions of the committee made before the change of jurisdiction remain binding legal precedent . Britain is a dualist in its relationship with international law , i.e. , international obligations have to be formally incorporated into English law before the courts are obliged to apply supranational laws . For example , the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms was signed in 1950 and Britain allowed individuals to directly petition the European Commission on Human Rights from 1966 . Now s6 ( 1 ) Human Rights Act 1998 ( HRA ) makes it unlawful `` ... for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a convention right '' , where a `` public authority '' is any person or body which exercises a public function , expressly including the courts but expressly excluding Parliament . Although the European Convention has begun to be applied to the acts of non-state agents , the HRA does not make the Convention specifically applicable between private parties . Courts have taken the Convention into account in interpreting the common law . They also must take the Convention into account in interpreting Acts of Parliament , but must ultimately follow the terms of the Act even if inconsistent with the Convention ( s3 HRA ) . Similarly , because Britain remains a strong international trading nation , international consistency of decision making is of vital importance , so Admiralty Law is strongly influenced by Public International Law and the modern commercial treaties and conventions regulating shipping . Application to Wales ( edit ) Unlike Scotland and Northern Ireland , Wales is not a separate jurisdiction within the United Kingdom . The customary laws of Wales within the Kingdom of England were abolished by King Henry VIII 's Laws in Wales Acts which brought Wales into legal conformity with England . While Wales now has a devolved Assembly , any legislation which that Assembly passes is enacted in particular circumscribed policy areas defined by the Government of Wales Act 2006 , other legislation of the British Parliament , or by Orders in Council given under the authority of the 2006 Act . Between 1746 and 1967 , any reference to England in legislation was deemed to include Wales . This ceased with the enactment of the Welsh Language Act 1967 and the jurisdiction is now commonly referred to as `` England and Wales '' . Although devolution has accorded some degree of political autonomy to Wales in the National Assembly for Wales , it did not have the ability to pass primary legislation until the Government of Wales Act 2006 came into force after the 2007 Welsh general election . That said , the Welsh legal system remains English common law , in that the legal system administered through both civil and criminal courts remains unified throughout England and Wales . This is different from the situation of Northern Ireland , for example , which did not cease to be a distinct jurisdiction when its legislature was suspended ( see Northern Ireland ( Temporary Provisions ) Act 1972 ) . A major difference is also the use of the Welsh language , as laws concerning it apply in Wales and not in the rest of the United Kingdom . The Welsh Language Act 1993 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom , which put the Welsh language on an equal footing with the English language in Wales with regard to the public sector . Welsh may also be spoken in Welsh courts .

The main elements of a crime are the actus reus ( doing something which is criminally prohibited ) and a mens rea ( having the requisite criminal state of mind , usually intention or recklessness ) . A prosecutor must show that a person has caused the offensive conduct , or that the culprit had some pre-existing duty to take steps to avoid a criminal consequence . The types of different crimes range from those well known ones like manslaughter , murder , theft and robbery to a plethora of regulatory and statutory offences . It is estimated that in the UK , there are 3,500 classes of criminal offence . Certain defences may exist to crimes , which include self - defence , intention , necessity , duress , and in the case of a murder charge , under the Homicide Act 1957 , diminished responsibility , provocation and , in very rare cases , survival of a suicide pact . It has often been suggested that England and Wales should codify its criminal law in an English Criminal Code , but there has been no overwhelming support for this in the past .

Members of the Lok Sabha are elected by adult universal suffrage and a first - past - the - post system to represent their respective constituencies , and they hold their seats for five years or until the body is dissolved by the President on the advice of the council of ministers . The house meets in the Lok Sabha Chambers of the Sansad Bhavan in New Delhi . The maximum strength of the House allotted by the Constitution of India is 552 . Currently the house has 545 seats which is made up by election of up to 543 elected members and at a maximum , 2 nominated members of the Anglo - Indian Community by the President of India . A total of 131 seats ( 24.03 % ) are reserved for representatives of Scheduled Castes ( 84 ) and Scheduled Tribes ( 47 ) . The quorum for the House is 10 % of the total membership . The Lok Sabha , unless sooner dissolved , continues to operate for five years from the date appointed for its first meeting . However , while a proclamation of emergency is in operation , this period may be extended by Parliament by law . An exercise to redraw Lok Sabha constituencies ' boundaries is carried out by a Delimitation Commission every decade based on the Indian census , last of which was conducted in 2001 . This exercise earlier also included redistribution of seats among states based on demographic changes but that provision of the mandate of the commission was suspended in 1976 following a constitutional amendment to incentivise the family planning programme which was being implemented . The 16th Lok Sabha was elected in May 2014 and is the latest to date . The Lok Sabha has its own television channel , Lok Sabha TV , headquartered within the premises of Parliament .

( March 2014 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) A major portion of the Indian subcontinent was under British rule from 1858 to 1947 . During this period , the office of the Secretary of State for India ( along with the Council of India ) was the authority through whom British Parliament exercised its rule in the Indian sub-continent , and the office of Viceroy of India was created , along with an Executive Council in India , consisting of high officials of the British government . The Indian Councils Act 1861 provided for a Legislative Council consisting of the members of the Executive Council and non-official members . The Indian Councils Act 1892 established legislatures in each of the provinces of British India and increased the powers of the Legislative Council . Although these Acts increased the representation of Indians in the government , their power still remained limited , and the electorate very small . The Indian Councils Act 1909 and the Government of India Act 1919 further expanded the participation of Indians in the administration . The Indian Independence Act , passed by the British parliament on 18 July 1947 , divided British India ( which did not include the Princely States ) into two new independent countries , India and Pakistan , which were to be dominions under the Crown until they had each enacted a new constitution . The Constituent Assembly was divided into two for the separate nations , with each new Assembly having sovereign powers transferred to it for the respective dominion . The Constitution of India was adopted on 26 November 1949 and came into effect on 26 January 1950 , proclaiming India to be a sovereign , democratic republic . This contained the founding principles of the law of the land which would govern India in its new form , which now included all the princely states which had not acceded to Pakistan . According to Article 79 ( Part V - The Union . ) of the Constitution of India , the Parliament of India consists of the President of India and the two Houses of Parliament known as the Council of States ( Rajya Sabha ) and the House of the People ( Lok Sabha ) . The Lok Sabha ( House of the Leaders ) was duly constituted for the first time on 17 April 1952 after the first General Elections held from 25 October 1951 to 21 February 1952 . Session of Lok Sabha commenced on Date Session No . Date First 13 May 1952 Second April 1957 Third April 1962 Fourth March 1967 Fifth March 1971 Sixth March 1977 Seventh January 1980 Eighth December 1984 Ninth December 1989 Tenth June 1991 Eleventh May 1996 Twelfth March 1998 Thirteenth October 1999 Fourteenth May 2004 Fifteenth May 2009 Sixteenth ( Current ) May 2014 Qualifications ( edit ) See also : Election Commission of India Article 84 ( Part V. -- The Union ) of Indian Constitution sets qualifications for being a member of Lok Sabha , which are as follows : He / She should be a citizen of India , and must subscribe before the Election Commission of India an oath or affirmation according to the form set out for the purpose in the Third Schedule of Indian Constitution . He / She should not be less than 25 years of age . He / She possesses such other qualifications as may be prescribed in that behalf by or under any law made by Parliament . He / She should not be proclaimed criminal i.e. they should not be a convict , a confirmed debtor or otherwise disqualified by law ; and He / She should have his / her name in the electoral rolls in any part of the country . However , a member can be disqualified of being a member of Parliament : If he / she holds office of profit ; If he / she is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a competent court If he / she is an undischarged insolvent ; If he / she is not a citizen of India , or has voluntarily acquired the citizenship of a foreign State , or is under any acknowledgment of allegiance or adherence to a foreign State ; If he / she is violating party discipline ( as per Tenth schedule of the constitution ) ; disqualified under Representation of People Act . A seat in the Lok Sabha will become vacant in the following circumstances : ( during normal functioning of the House ) When the holder of the seat , by writing to the speaker , resigns . When the holder of the seat is absent from 60 consecutive days of proceedings of the House , without prior permission of the Speaker . When the holder of the seat is subject to any disqualifications mentioned in the Constitution or any law enacted by Parliament . A seat may also be vacated when the holder stands disqualified under the ' Anti-Defection Law ' . Furthermore , as per article 101 ( Part V. -- The Union ) of Indian Constitution ; A person can not be : ( 1 ) a member of both Houses of Parliament and provision shall be made by Parliament by law for the vacation by a person who is chosen a member of both Houses of his seat in one House or the other. ( 2 ) a member both of Parliament and of a House of the Legislature of a State . System of elections in Lok Sabha Members of the Lok Sabha are directly elected by the people of India , on the basis of Universal Suffrage . For the purpose of holding direct elections to Lok Sabha ; each state is divided into territorial constituencies . In this respect , the constitution of India makes the following two provisions : Each state is allotted a number of seats in the Lok Sabha in such a manner that the ratio between that number and its population is same for all the states of India . This provision does not apply for states having a population of less than 6 million ( 60 lakhs ) . Each state is divided into territorial constituencies in such a manner that the ratio between the population of each constituency and the number of seats allotted to it remain the same throughout the state . Note : The expression population here refers to the population ascertained at the preceding census ( 2001 Census ) of which relevant figure have been published . Powers ( edit ) The Lok Sabha has certain powers that make it more powerful than the Rajya Sabha . Motions of no confidence against the government can be introduced and passed in the Lok Sabha . If passed by a majority vote , the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers resign collectively . The Rajya Sabha has no power over such a motion , and hence has no real power over the executive . This is because the Constitution of India has only made the Union Council of ministers responsible to the Lok Sabha , not to the Rajya Sabha . Money bills can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha , and upon being passed , are sent to the Rajya Sabha , where it can be deliberated on for up to 14 days . If not rejected by the Rajya Sabha , or 14 days lapse from the introduction of the bill in the Rajya Sabha without any action by the House , or recommendations made by the Rajya Sabha are not accepted by the Lok Sabha , the bill is considered passed . The budget is presented in the Lok Sabha by the Finance Minister in the name of the President of India . In matters pertaining to non-financial ( ordinary ) bills , after the bill has been passed by the House where it was originally tabled ( Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha ) , it is sent to the other house , where it may be kept for a maximum period of 6 months . If the other House rejects the bill or a period of 6 months elapses without any action by that House , or the House that originally tabled the bill does not accept the recommendations made by the members of the other house , it results in a deadlock . This is resolved by a joint session of both Houses , presided over by the speaker of the Lok Sabha and decided by a simple majority . Though the Constitution has placed both houses on the same footing in this regard , in reality it is the Lok Sabha 's opinions that mostly prevails -- due to its bigger numerical strength . Equal Powers with the Rajya Sabha in initiating and passing any Bill for Constitutional Amendment ( by a majority of the total membership of the House and at least two - thirds majority of the members present and voting ) . Equal Powers with the Rajya Sabha in initiating and passing a motion for the impeachment of the President ( by two - thirds of the membership of the House ) . Equal Powers with the Rajya Sabha in impeachment process ( initiating and passing a motion for the removal ) of the judges of the Supreme Court and the state High Courts ( by a majority of the membership of the House and at least two - thirds majority of the members present and voting ) , who then can be removed by the President of India . Equal Powers with the Rajya Sabha in initiating and passing a resolution declaring war or national emergency ( by two - thirds majority ) or constitutional emergency ( by simple majority ) in a state . If the Lok Sabha is dissolved before or after the declaration of a National Emergency , the Rajya Sabha becomes the sole Parliament . It can not be dissolved . This is a limitation on the Lok Sabha . But there is a possibility that president can exceed the term to not more than 1 year under the proclamation of emergency and the same would be lowered down to six - month if the said proclamation ceases to operate . In conclusion , it is clear that the Lok Sabha is more powerful than the Rajya Sabha in almost all matters . Even in those matters in which the Constitution has placed both Houses on an equal footing , the Lok Sabha has more influence due to its greater numerical strength . This is typical of any Parliamentary democracy , with the lower House always being more powerful than the upper . Procedure ( edit ) Procedure in the House ( edit ) The Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha and Directions issued by the Speaker from time to time there under regulate the procedure in Lok Sabha . The items of business , notice of which is received from the Ministers / Private Members and admitted by the Speaker , are included in the daily List of Business which is printed and circulated to members in advance . For various items of business to be taken up in the House the time is allotted by the House on the recommendations of the Business Advisory Committee . The Speaker presides over the sessions of the House and regulates procedure . Sessions and time of sittings ( edit ) Three sessions of Lok Sabha take place in a year : Budget session : February to May . Monsoon session : July to September . Winter session : November to mid December . When in session , Lok Sabha holds its sittings usually from 11 A.M. to 1 P.M. and from 2 P.M. to 6 P.M. On some days the sittings are continuously held without observing lunch break and are also extended beyond 6 P.M. depending upon the business before the House . Lok Sabha does not ordinarily sit on Saturdays and Sundays and other closed holidays . Question Hour / Zero Hour ( edit ) The first hour of every sitting is called Question Hour . Asking questions in Parliament is the free and unfettered right of members , and during Question Hour they may ask questions of ministers on different aspects of administration and government policy in the national and international spheres . Every minister whose turn it is to answer to questions has to stand up and answer for his department 's acts of omission or commission . Questions are of three types -- Starred , Unstarred and Short Notice . A Starred Question is one to which a member desires an oral answer in the House and which is distinguished by an asterisk mark . An unstarred Question is one which is not called for oral answer in the house and on which no supplementary questions can consequently be asked . An answer to such a question is given in writing . Minimum period of notice for starred / unstarred question is 10 clear days . If the questions given notice of are admitted by the Speaker , they are listed and printed for answer on the dates allotted to the Ministries to which the subject matter of the question pertains . The normal period of notice does not apply to short notice questions which relate to matters of urgent public importance . However , a Short Notice Question may be answered only on short notice if so permitted by the Speaker and the Minister concerned is prepared to answer it at shorter notice . A short notice question is taken up for answer immediately after the Question Hour , popularly known as Zero Hour . Zero Hour : The time immediately following the Question Hour has come to be known as `` Zero Hour '' . It starts at around 12 noon ( hence the name ) and members can , with prior notice to the Speaker , raise issues of importance during this time . Typically , discussions on important Bills , the Budget , and other issues of national importance take place from 2 pm onwards . Business after question Hour ( edit ) After the Question Hour , the House takes up miscellaneous items of work before proceeding to the main business of the day . These may consist of one or more of the following : Adjournment Motions , Questions involving breaches of Privileges , Papers to be laid on the Table , Communication of any messages from Rajya Sabha , Intimations regarding President 's assent to Bills , Calling Attention Notices , Matters under Rule 377 , Presentation of Reports of Parliamentary Committee , Presentation of Petitions , miscellaneous statements by Ministers , Motions regarding elections to Committees , Bills to be withdrawn or introduced . Main business ( edit ) The main business of the day may be consideration of a Bill or financial business or consideration of a resolution or a motion . Legislative business ( edit ) Legislative proposals in the form of a Bill can be brought forward either by a Minister or by a private member . In the former case it is known as Government Bill and in the latter case it is known as a Private Members ' Bill . Every Bill passes through three stages -- called three readings -- before it is passed . To become law it must be passed by both the Houses of Parliament , Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha , and then assented to by the president . Financial business ( edit ) The presentation , discussion of , and voting on the annual General and Railways budgets -- followed by the passing of the Appropriations Bill and the Finance Bill -- is a long , drawn - out process that takes up a major part of the time of the House during its Budget Session every year . Motions and resolutions ( edit ) Among other kinds of business that come up before the House are resolutions and motions . Resolutions and motions may be brought forward by Government or by private members . Government may move a resolution or a motion for obtaining the sanction to a scheme or opinion of the House on an important matter of policy or on a grave situation . Similarly , a private member may move a resolution or motion in order to draw the attention of the House and of the Government to a particular problem . The last two and half hours of sitting on every Friday are generally allotted for transaction of private members ' business . While private members ' bills are taken up on one Friday , private members ' resolutions are taken up on the succeeding Friday , and so on . Half - an - Hour discussion ( edit ) A Half - an - Hour Discussion can be raised on a matter of sufficient public importance which has been the subject of a recent question in Lok Sabha irrespective of the fact whether the question was answered orally or the answer was laid on the Table of the House and the answer which needs elucidation on a matter of fact . Normally not more than half an hour is allowed for such a discussion . Usually , half - an - hour discussion is listed on Mondays , Wednesdays and Fridays only . In one session , a member is allowed to raise not more than two half - an - hour discussions . During the discussion , the member , who has given notice , makes a short statement and not more than four members , who have intimated earlier and have secured one of the four places in the ballot , are permitted to ask a question each for further elucidating any matter of fact . Thereafter , the Minister concerned replies . There is no formal motion before the House nor voting . Discussion on matters of urgent public importance ( edit ) Members may raise discussions on matters of urgent public importance with the permission of the Speaker . Such discussions may take place on two days in a week . No formal motion is moved in the House nor is there any voting on such a discussion . Debate in the House ( edit ) After the member who initiates discussion on an item of business has spoken , other members can speak on that item of business in such order as the Speaker may call upon them . Only one member can speak at a time and all speeches are directed to the Chair . A matter requiring the decision of the House is decided by means of a question put by the Speaker on a motion made by a member . Division ( edit ) A division is one of the forms in which the decision of the House is ascertained . Normally , when a motion is put to the House members for and against it indicate their opinion by saying `` Aye '' or `` No '' from their seats . The Chair goes by the voices and declares that the motion is either accepted or rejected by the House . If a member challenges the decision , the Chair orders that the lobbies be cleared . Then the division bell is rung and an entire network of bells installed in the various parts and rooms in Parliament House and Parliament House Annexe rings continuously for three and a half minutes . Members and Ministers rush to the Chamber from all sides . After the bell stops , all the doors to the Chamber are closed and nobody can enter or leave the Chamber till the division is over . Then the Chair puts the question for second time and declares whether in its opinion the `` Ayes '' or the `` Noes '' , have it . If the opinion so declared is again challenged , the Chair asks the votes to be recorded by operating the Automatic Vote Recording Equipment . Automatic vote Recording system ( edit ) With the announcement of the Speaker for recording the votes , the Secretary - General presses the button of a key board . Then a gong sounds serving as a signal to members for casting their votes . For casting a vote each member present in the Chamber has to press a switch and then operate one of the three push buttons fixed in his seat . The push switch must be kept pressed simultaneously until the gong sounds for the second time after 10 seconds . There are two Indicator Boards installed in the wall on either side of the Speaker 's Chair in the Chamber . Each vote cast by a member is flashed here . Immediately after the votes are cast , they are totalled mechanically and the details of the results are flashed on the Result Indicator Boards installed in the railings of the Speaker 's and Diplomatic Galleries . Divisions are normally held with the aid of the Automatic Vote Recording Equipment . Where so directed by the Speaker in terms of relevant provision in the Rules of Procedure etc. in Lok Sabha , Divisions may be held either by distribution of ' Aye ' / ' No ' and ' Abstention ' slips to members in the House or by the members recording their votes by going into the lobbies . There is an Indicator Board in the machine room showing the name of each member . The result of Division and vote cast by each member with the aid of Automatic Vote Recording Equipment appear on this Board also . Immediately a photograph of the Indicator Board is taken . Later the Photograph is enlarged and the names of members who voted ' Ayes ' and for ' Noes ' are determined with the help of the photograph and incorporated in Lok Sabha Debates . Publication of Debates ( edit ) Three versions of Lok Sabha Debates are prepared viz. , the Hindi version , the English version and the Original version . Only the Hindi and English versions are printed . The Original version , in cyclostyled form , is kept in the Parliament Library for record and reference . The Hindi version all Questions asked and Answers given thereto in Hindi and the speeches made in Hindi as also verbatim Hindi translation of Questions and Answers and of speeches made in English or in regional languages . The English version contains Lok Sabha proceedings in English and the English translation of the proceedings which take place in Hindi or in any regional language . The Original version , however , contains proceedings in Hindi or in English as they actually take place in the House and also the English / Hindi translation of speeches made in regional languages . If conflicting legislation is enacted by the two Houses , a joint sitting is held to resolve the differences . In such a session , the members of the Lok Sabha would generally prevail , since the Lok Sabha includes more than twice as many members as the Rajya Sabha . Officers of Lok Sabha ( edit ) Speaker and Deputy Speaker As per Article 93 of Indian Constitution , the Lok Sabha has a Speaker and a Deputy Speaker . In the Lok Sabha , the lower House of the Indian Parliament , both presiding officers -- the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker - are elected from among its members by a simple majority of members present and voting in the House . As such , no specific qualifications are prescribed for being elected the Speaker . The Constitution only requires that Speaker should be a member of the House . But an understanding of the Constitution and the laws of the country and the rules of procedure and conventions of Parliament is considered a major asset for the holder of the office of the Speaker . Vacation and resignation of , and removal from , the offices of Speaker and Deputy Speaker is mentioned under Article 94 of the Constitution of India . As per Article 94 of Indian Constitution . A Speaker or a Deputy Speaker , should vacate his / her office , a ) if he / she ceases to be a member of the House of the People , b ) he / she resigns , c ) removed from his office by a resolution of the House of the People passed by a majority . The Speaker of Lok Sabha is at once a member of the House and also its Presiding Officer . The Speaker of the Lok Sabha conducts the business in the house . He / she decides whether a bill is a money bill or not . He / she maintains discipline and decorum in the house and can punish a member for their unruly behaviour by suspending them . He / she permits the moving of various kinds of motions and resolutions like the motion of no confidence , motion of adjournment , motion of censure and calling attention notice as per the rules . The Speaker decides on the agenda to be taken up for discussion during the meeting . It is the Speaker of the Lok Sabha who presides over joint sittings called in the event of disagreement between the two Houses on a legislative measure . Following the 52nd Constitution amendment , the Speaker is vested with the power relating to the disqualification of a member of the Lok Sabha on grounds of defection . The Speaker makes obituary references in the House , formal references to important national and international events and the valedictory address at the conclusion of every Session of the Lok Sabha and also when the term of the House expires . Though a member of the House , the Speaker does not vote in the House except on those rare occasions when there is a tie at the end of a decision . Till date , the Speaker of the Lok Sabha has not been called upon to exercise this unique casting vote . While the office of Speaker is vacant due to absence / resignation / removal , the duties of the office shall be performed by the Deputy Speaker or , if the office of Deputy Speaker is also vacant , by such member of the House of the People as the President may appoint for the purpose . Shri G.V. Mavalankar was the first Speaker of Lok Sabha ( 15 May 1952 - 27 February 1956 ) and Shri M. Ananthasayanam Ayyangar was the first Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha ( 30 May 1952 -- 7 March 1956 ) . In the 16th Lok Sabha , Sumitra Mahajan was elected as the speaker on 3 June 2014 , and is its second woman speaker and Shri M. Thambidurai as the deputy speaker .

Its name came from its ability to outdistance other horse breeds in races of a quarter mile or less ; some have been clocked at speeds up to 55 mph ( 88.5 km / h ) . The American Quarter Horse is the most popular breed in the United States today , and the American Quarter Horse Association is the largest breed registry in the world , with almost 3 million living American Quarter Horses registered in 2014 . The American Quarter Horse is well known both as a race horse and for its performance in rodeos , horse shows and as a working ranch horse . The compact body of the American Quarter Horse is well - suited to the intricate and speedy maneuvers required in reining , cutting , working cow horse , barrel racing , calf roping , and other western riding events , especially those involving live cattle . The American Quarter Horse is also shown in English disciplines , driving , and many other equestrian activities .

One of the most famous of these early imports was Janus , a Thoroughbred who was the grandson of the Godolphin Arabian . He was foaled in 1746 , and imported to colonial Virginia in 1756 . The influence of Thoroughbreds like Janus contributed genes crucial to the development of the colonial `` Quarter Horse '' . The breed is sometimes referred to as the `` Famous American Quarter Running Horse '' . The resulting horse was small , hardy , and quick , and was used as a work horse during the week and a race horse on the weekends . As flat racing became popular with the colonists , the Quarter Horse gained even more popularity as a sprinter over courses that , by necessity , were shorter than the classic racecourses of England , and were often no more than a straight stretch of road or flat piece of open land . When matched against a Thoroughbred , local sprinters often won . As the Thoroughbred breed became established in America , many colonial Quarter Horses were included in the original American stud books , starting a long association between the Thoroughbred breed and what would later become officially known as the `` Quarter Horse '' , named after the ⁄ mile ( 0.40 km ) race distance at which it excelled . with some individuals being clocked at up to 55 mph . Westward expansion ( edit ) In the 19th century , pioneers heading West needed a hardy , willing horse . On the Great Plains , settlers encountered horses that descended from the Spanish stock Hernán Cortés and other Conquistadors had introduced into the viceroyalty of New Spain , which today includes the Southwestern United States and Mexico . These horses of the west included herds of feral animals known as Mustangs , as well as horses domesticated by Native Americans , including the Comanche , Shoshoni and Nez Perce tribes . As the colonial Quarter Horse was crossed with these western horses , the pioneers found that the new crossbred had innate `` cow sense '' , a natural instinct for working with cattle , making it popular with cattlemen on ranches . Development as a distinct breed ( edit ) See also : American Quarter Horse Association and American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame A photograph of Peter McCue , taken in Oklahoma around 1905 . Early foundation sires of Quarter horse type included Steel Dust , foaled 1843 ; Shiloh ( or Old Shiloh ) , foaled 1844 ; Old Cold Deck ( 1862 ) ; Lock 's Rondo , one of many `` Rondo '' horses , foaled in 1880 ; Old Billy -- again , one of many `` Billy '' horses -- foaled circa 1880 ; Traveler , a stallion of unknown breeding , known to have been in Texas by 1889 ; and Peter McCue , foaled 1895 , registered as a Thoroughbred but of disputed pedigree . The main duty of the ranch horse in the American West was working cattle . Even after the invention of the automobile , horses were still irreplaceable for handling livestock on the range . Thus , major Texas cattle ranches , such as the King Ranch , the 6666 ( Four Sixes ) Ranch , and the Waggoner Ranch played a significant role in the development of the modern Quarter Horse . The skills needed by cowboys and their horses became the foundation of the rodeo , a contest which began with informal competition between cowboys and expanded to become a major competitive event throughout the west . To this day , the Quarter Horse dominates the sport both in speed events and in competition that emphasizes the handling of live cattle . However , sprint races were also popular weekend entertainment and racing became a source of economic gain for breeders as well . As a result , more Thoroughbred blood was added back into the developing American Quarter Horse breed . The American Quarter Horse also benefitted from the addition of Arabian , Morgan , and even Standardbred bloodlines . In 1940 , the American Quarter Horse Association ( AQHA ) was formed by a group of horsemen and ranchers from the southwestern United States dedicated to preserving the pedigrees of their ranch horses . The horse honored with the first registration number , P - 1 , was Wimpy , a descendant of the King Ranch foundation sire Old Sorrel . Other sires alive at the founding of the AQHA were given the earliest registration numbers Joe Reed P - 3 , Chief P - 5 , Oklahoma Star P - 6 , Cowboy P - 12 , and Waggoner 's Rainy Day P - 13 . The Thoroughbred race horse Three Bars , alive in the early years of the AQHA , is recognized by the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame as one of the significant foundation sires for the Quarter Horse breed . Other significant Thoroughbred sires seen in early AQHA pedigrees include Rocket Bar , Top Deck and Depth Charge . `` Appendix '' and `` Foundation '' Horses ( edit ) Since the American Quarter Horse formally established itself as a breed , the AQHA stud book has remained open to additional Thoroughbred blood via a performance standard . An `` Appendix '' American Quarter Horse is a first generation cross between a registered Thoroughbred and an American Quarter Horse or a cross between a `` numbered '' American Quarter Horse and an `` appendix '' American Quarter Horse . The resulting offspring is registered in the `` appendix '' of the American Quarter Horse Association 's studbook , hence the nickname . Horses listed in the appendix may be entered in competition , but offspring are not initially eligible for full AQHA registration . If the Appendix horse meets certain conformational criteria and is shown or raced successfully in sanctioned AQHA events , the horse can earn its way from the appendix into the permanent studbook , making its offspring eligible for AQHA registration . Since Quarter Horse / Thoroughbred crosses continue to enter the official registry of the American Quarter Horse breed , this creates a continual gene flow from the Thoroughbred breed into the American Quarter Horse breed , which has altered many of the characteristics that typified the breed in the early years of its formation . Some breeders , who argue that the continued infusion of Thoroughbred bloodlines is beginning to compromise the integrity of the breed standard , favor the earlier style of horse and have created several separate organizations to promote and register `` Foundation '' Quarter Horses . American Quarter Horses today ( edit ) The Quarter Horse is well - suited for the western disciplines . The American Quarter Horse is best known today as a show horse , race horse , reining and cutting horse , rodeo competitor , ranch horse , and all - around family horse . Quarter Horses compete well in rodeo events such as barrel racing , calf roping and team roping ; and gymkhana or O - Mok - See . Other stock horse events such as cutting and reining are open to all breeds but also dominated by American Quarter Horse . Large purses allow top competitors to earnover a million dollars in these events . The breed is not only well - suited for western riding and cattle work . Many race tracks offer Quarter Horses a wide assortment of pari - mutuel horse racing with purses in the millions . Quarter Horses have also been trained to compete in dressage and can be good jumpers . They are also used for recreational trail riding and in mounted police units . The American Quarter Horse has also been exported worldwide . European nations such as Germany and Italy have imported large numbers of Quarter Horses . Next to the American Quarter Horse Association ( which also encompasses Quarter Horses from Canada ) , the second largest registry of Quarter Horses is in Brazil , followed by Australia . With the internationalization of the discipline of reining and its acceptance as one of the official seven events of the World Equestrian Games , there is a growing international interest in Quarter Horses . Countries like Japan , Switzerland and Israel that did not have traditional stock horse industries have begun to compete with American Quarter Horses in their own nations and internationally . The American Quarter Horse is the most popular breed in the United States today , and the American Quarter Horse Association is the largest breed registry in the world , with over 5 million American Quarter Horses registered worldwide . Breed characteristics ( edit ) A halter - type Quarter Horse The Quarter Horse has a small , short , refined head with a straight profile , and a strong , well - muscled body , featuring a broad chest and powerful , rounded hindquarters . They usually stand between 14 and 16 hands ( 56 and 64 inches , 142 and 163 cm ) high , although some Halter - type and English hunter - type horses may grow as tall as 17 hands ( 68 inches , 173 cm ) . There are two main body types : the stock type and the hunter or racing type . The stock horse type is shorter , more compact , stocky and well - muscled , yet agile . The racing and hunter type Quarter Horses are somewhat taller and smoother muscled than the stock type , more closely resembling the Thoroughbred . Quarter Horses come in nearly all colors . The most common color is sorrel , a brownish red , part of the color group called chestnut by most other breed registries . Other recognized colors include bay , black , brown , buckskin , palomino , gray , dun , red dun , grullo ( also occasionally referred to as blue dun ) , red roan , blue roan , bay roan , perlino , cremello , and white . In the past , spotted color patterns were excluded , but now with the advent of DNA testing to verify parentage , the registry accepts all colors as long as both parents are registered . Stock type ( edit ) See also : Stock horse A stock horse is a horse of a type that is well suited for working with livestock , particularly cattle . Reining and cutting horses are smaller in stature , with quick , agile movements and very powerful hindquarters . Western pleasure show horses are often slightly taller , with slower movements , smoother gaits , and a somewhat more level topline -- though still featuring the powerful hindquarters characteristic of the Quarter Horse . Halter type ( edit ) Horses shown in - hand in Halter competition are larger yet , with a very heavily muscled appearance , while retaining small heads with wide jowls and refined muzzles . There is controversy amongst owners , breeder and veterinarians regarding the health effects of the extreme muscle mass that is currently fashionable in the specialized halter horse , which typically is 15.2 to 16 hands ( 62 to 64 inches , 157 to 163 cm ) and weighs in at over 1,200 pounds ( 540 kg ) when fitted for halter competition . Not only are there concerns about the weight to frame ratio on the horse 's skeletal system , but the massive build is also linked to HYPP in descendants of the stallion Impressive ( see Genetic diseases below ) . Racing and hunter type ( edit ) A Quarter Horse warming up for hunt seat competition . Quarter Horse race horses are bred to sprint short distances ranging from 220 to 870 yards . Thus , they have long legs and are leaner than their stock type counterparts , but are still characterized by muscular hindquarters and powerful legs . Quarter Horses race primarily against other Quarter Horses , and their sprinting ability has earned them the nickname , `` the world 's fastest athlete . '' The show hunter type is slimmer , even more closely resembling a Thoroughbred , usually reflecting a higher percentage of appendix breeding . They are shown in hunter / jumper classes at both breed shows and in open USEF - rated horse show competition . Genetic diseases ( edit ) There are several genetic diseases of concern to Quarter Horse breeders : Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis ( HYPP ) , which is caused by an autosomal dominant gene linked to the stallion Impressive . It is characterized by uncontrollable muscle twitching and substantial muscle weakness or paralysis among affected horses . Because it is a dominant gene , only one parent has to have the gene for it to be transmitted to offspring . There is a DNA test for HYPP , which is required by the AQHA . Since 2007 , the AQHA bars registration of horses who possess the homozygous form ( H / H ) of the gene , and though heterozygous ( H / N ) horses are still eligible for registration , altering that status is currently being discussed . Additionally all Quarter Horses born 2007 or later that are confirmed to be descendants of Impressive must carry a note about the risks of HYPP on their registration papers . Due to HYPP , the halter classes are undergoing significant changes . Halter classes are dominated by the Impressive bloodline . Impressive , a very prolific halter horse , brought to the stock breeds the muscle mass that is popular in halter competition today . This muscle mass is linked to HYPP , and as the condition is reduced within the breed , the style of horse in halter classes is also likely to change . Already there have been rule changes , including the creation of a `` Performance Halter class '' in which a horse must possess a Register of Merit in performance or racing before it can compete . Malignant hyperthermia . A causative mutated allele , ryanodine receptor 1 gene ( RyR1 ) at nucleotide C7360G , generating a R2454G amino acid substitution . has been identified in the American Quarter Horse and breeds with Quarter Horse ancestry , inherited as an autosomal dominant It can be caused by overwork , anesthesia , or stress . Hereditary Equine Regional Dermal Asthenia ( HERDA ) , also known as hyperelastosis cutis ( HC ) . This is caused by an autosomal recessive gene , and thus , unlike HYPP , HERDA can only be transmitted if both parents carry the gene . When a horse has this disease , there is a collagen defect that results in the layers of skin not being held firmly together . Thus , when the horse is ridden under saddle or suffers trauma to the skin , the outer layer often splits or separates from the deeper layer , or it can tear off completely . It rarely heals without disfiguring scars . Sunburn can also be a concern . In dramatic cases , the skin can split along the back and even roll down the sides , with the horse literally being skinned alive . Most horses with HERDA are euthanized for humane reasons between the age of two and four years . The very hotly debated and controversial theory , put forth by researchers at Cornell University and Mississippi State University is that the sire line of the great foundation stallion Poco Bueno is implicated as the origin of the disease . As of May 9 , 2007 , Researchers working independently at Cornell University and at the University of California , Davis announced that a DNA test for HERDA has been developed . Over 1,500 horses were tested during the development phase of the test , which is now available to the general public through both institutions . Glycogen Branching Enzyme Deficiency ( GBED ) is a genetic disease where the horse is lacking an enzyme necessary for storing glycogen , the horse 's heart muscle and skeletal muscles can not function , leading to rapid death . The disease occurs in foals who are homozygous for the lethal GBED allele , meaning both parents carry one copy of the gene . The stallion King P - 234 has been linked to this disease . There is a DNA blood test for this gene . Equine polysaccharide storage myopathy , also called EPSM or PSSM , is a metabolic muscular condition in horses that causes tying up , and is also related to a glycogen storage disorder . While also seen in some draft horse breeds , PSSM has been traced to three specific but undisclosed bloodlines in Quarter Horses , with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern . 48 % of Quarter Horses with symptoms of neuromuscular disease have PSSM . To some extent it can be diet controlled with specialized low - starch diets , but genetic testing is advised before breeding , as the condition exists at a subclinical level in approximately 6 % of the general Quarter Horse population . Lethal White Syndrome . Although `` cropout '' Quarter Horses with Paint markings were not allowed to be registered for many years , the gene for such markings is a recessive and continued to periodically appear in Quarter Horse foals . Thus , it is believed that some Quarter Horses may carry the gene for Lethal White Syndrome . There is a DNA test for this condition .

His record - breaking win in the Belmont Stakes , where he left the field 31 lengths behind him , is widely regarded as one of the greatest races of all time . During his racing career , he won five Eclipse Awards , including Horse of the Year honors at ages two and three . He was elected to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1974 . In the List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century , Secretariat is second only to Man o ' War ( racing career 1919 -- 1920 ) , who also was a large chestnut colt given the nickname `` Big Red '' . At age two , Secretariat finished fourth in his 1972 debut in a maiden race , but then won seven of his remaining eight starts , including five stakes victories . His only loss during this period was in the Champagne Stakes , where he finished first but was disqualified to second for interference . He received the Eclipse Award for champion two - year - old colt , and also was the 1972 Horse of the Year , a rare honor for a horse so young . At age three , Secretariat not only won the Triple Crown , he set speed records in all three races . His time in the Kentucky Derby still stands as the Churchill Downs track record for 1 ⁄ miles , and his time in the Belmont Stakes stands as the American record for 1 ⁄ miles on the dirt . His controversial time in the Preakness Stakes was eventually recognized as a stakes record in 2012 . Secretariat 's win in the Gotham Stakes tied the track record for 1 mile , he set a world record in the Marlboro Cup at 1 ⁄ miles and further proved his versatility by winning two major stakes races on turf . He lost three times that year : in the Wood Memorial , Whitney and Woodward Stakes , but the brilliance of his nine wins made him an American icon . He won his second Horse of the Year title , plus Eclipse Awards for champion three - year - old colt and champion turf horse . At the beginning of his three - year - old year , Secretariat was syndicated for a record - breaking $6.08 million on condition that he be retired from racing by the end of the year . Although he sired several successful racehorses , he ultimately was most influential through his daughters ' offspring , becoming the leading broodmare sire in North America in 1992 . Secretariat died in 1989 due to laminitis . His daughters produced several notable sires , including Storm Cat , A.P. Indy , Gone West , Dehere and Chief 's Crown , and through them Secretariat appears in the pedigree of many modern champions . He continues to be recognized as one of the greatest horses in American racing history .

Secretariat was sired by Bold Ruler and his dam was Somethingroyal , a daughter of Princequillo . Bold Ruler was the leading sire in North America from 1963 to 1969 and again in 1973 . Owned by the Phipps family , Bold Ruler possessed both speed and stamina , having won the Preakness Stakes and Horse of the Year honors in 1957 , and American Champion Sprint Horse honors in 1958 . Bold Ruler was retired to stud at Claiborne Farm , but the Phippses owned most of the mares to which Bold Ruler was bred , and few of his offspring were sold at public auction . To bring new blood into their breeding program , the Phippses sometimes negotiated a foal - sharing agreement with other mare owners : Instead of charging a stud fee for Bold Ruler , they would arrange for multiple matings with Bold Ruler , either with two mares in one year or one mare over a two - year period . Assuming two foals were produced , the Phipps family would keep one and the mare 's owner would keep the other , with a coin toss determining who received first pick . Under such an arrangement , Chenery sent two mares to be bred to Bold Ruler in 1968 , Hasty Matelda and Somethingroyal . She then sent Cicada and Somethingroyal in 1969 . The foal - sharing agreement stated that the winner of the coin toss would get first foal pick of the foals produced in 1969 , while the loser of the toss would get first pick of the foals due in 1970 . In the spring of 1969 , a colt and filly were produced . In the 1969 breeding season , Cicada did not conceive , leaving only one foal due in the spring of 1970 . Thus , the winner of the coin toss would get only one foal ( the first pick from 1969 ) , and the loser would get two ( the second pick from 1969 and the only foal from 1970 ) . Chenery later said that both owners hoped they would lose the coin toss , which was held in the fall of 1969 in the office of New York Racing Association Chairman Alfred G. Vanderbilt II , with Arthur `` Bull '' Hancock of Claiborne Farm as witness . Ogden Phipps won the toss and took the 1969 weanling filly out of Somethingroyal . The filly was named The Bride and never won a race , though she did later become a stakes producer . Chenery received the Hasty Matelda colt in 1969 and the as - yet - unborn 1970 foal of Somethingroyal , which turned out to be Secretariat . Early years ' A foal is born at midnight And in the frosty morn The horseman eyes him fondly , And a secret hope is born . But breathe it not , nor whisper For fear of a neighbor 's scorn . He 's a chestnut colt , and he 's got a star . He may be another Man o ' War . Nay , say it aloud -- be shameless . Dream and hope and yearn , For there 's never a man among you But waits for his return . -- from `` Big Red '' , by J.A. Estes On March 30 , 1970 , at 12 : 10 a.m. at the Meadow Stud in Caroline County , Virginia , Somethingroyal foaled a bright - red chestnut colt with three white socks and a star with a narrow stripe . The foal stood when he was 45 minutes old and nursed 30 minutes later . Howard Gentry , the manager of Meadow Stud , was at the foaling and later said , `` He was a very well - made foal . He was as perfect a foal that I ever delivered . '' The colt soon distinguished himself from the others . `` He was always the leader in the crowd '' , said Gentry 's nephew , Robert , who also worked at the farm . `` To us , he was Big Red , and he had a personality . He was a clown and was always cutting up , always into some devilment . '' Some time later , Chenery got her first look at the foal and made a one word entry in her notebook : `` Wow ! '' That fall , Chenery and Elizabeth Ham , the Meadow 's longtime secretary , worked together to name the newly weaned colt . The first set of names submitted to the Jockey Club ( Sceptre , Royal Line and Something Special ) played on the names of his sire and dam , but were rejected . The second set , submitted in January 1971 , were Games of Chance , Deo Volonti ( God Willing ) and Secretariat , the last suggested by Ham based on her previous job associated with the secretariat of the League of Nations ( the predecessor of the United Nations ) . Appearance and conformation Equine anatomy Secretariat grew into a massive , powerful horse said to resemble his sire 's maternal grandsire , Discovery . He stood 16.2 hands ( 66 inches , 168 cm ) when fully grown . He was noted for being exceptionally well - balanced , a big , powerful horse described as having `` nearly perfect '' conformation and stride biomechanics . His chest was so large that he required a custom - made girth , and he was noted for his large , powerful , well - muscled hindquarters . An Australian trainer said of him , `` He is incredible , an absolutely perfect horse . I never saw anything like him . '' Secretariat 's absence of major conformation flaws was important , as horses with well made limbs and feet are less likely to become injured . Secretariat 's hindquarters were the main source of his power , with a sloped croup that extended the length of his femur . When in full stride , his hind legs were able to reach far under himself , increasing his drive . His ample girth , long back and well - made neck all contributed to his heart - lung efficiency . The manner in which Secretariat 's body parts fit together determined the efficiency of his stride , which affected his acceleration and endurance . Even very small differences in the length and angles of bones can have a major affect on performance . Secretariat was well put together even as a two - year - old , and by the time he was three , he had further matured in body and smoothed out his gait . The New York Racing Association 's Dr. M.A. Gilman , a veterinarian who routinely measured leading Thoroughbreds with a goal of applying science to create better ways to breed and evaluate racehorses , measured Secretariat 's development from two to three as follows : Measurement October aged 2 October aged 3 Height ( at withers ) 16 ⁄ hands ( 64.75 inches , 164 cm ) 16.1 ⁄ hands ( 65.5 inches , 166 cm ) Point of shoulder to point of shoulder ( chest width ) 16 inches ( 41 cm ) 16.5 inches ( 42 cm ) Girth ( around center of gravity ) 74 inches ( 188 cm ) 76 inches ( 193 cm ) Withers to point of shoulder 28 inches ( 71 cm ) 28.5 inches ( 72 cm ) Elbow to ground ( length of leg ) 37.5 inches ( 95 cm ) 38.5 inches ( 98 cm ) Point of shoulder to point of hip 46 inches ( 117 cm ) 49 inches ( 124 cm ) Point of hip to point of hip 25 inches ( 64 cm ) 26 inches ( 66 cm ) Point of hip to hock 40 inches ( 100 cm ) 40 inches ( 100 cm ) Point of hip to buttock 24 inches ( 61 cm ) 24 inches ( 61 cm ) Poll to withers ( neck length ) 40 inches ( 100 cm ) 40 inches ( 100 cm ) Buttock ( croup ) to ground ( height in rear ) 53.5 inches ( 136 cm ) 55.5 inches ( 141 cm ) Point of shoulder to point of buttock ( body length ) 68 inches ( 173 cm ) 69.5 inches ( 177 cm ) Circumference of cannon under knee 8.25 inches ( 21.0 cm ) 8.5 inches ( 22 cm ) Secretariat 's length of stride was considered large even after taking into account his large frame and strong build . While training for the Preakness Stakes , his stride was measured as 24 feet , 11 inches . His powerful hindquarters allowed him to unleash `` devastating '' speed and because he was so well - muscled and had significant cardiac capacity , he could simply out - gallop competitors at nearly any point in a race . His weight before the Gotham Stakes in April 1973 was 1,155 pounds ( 524 kg ) . After completing the grueling Triple Crown , his weight on June 15 had dropped only 24 pounds , to 1,131 pounds ( 513 kg ) . Secretariat was known for his appetite -- during his three - year - old campaign , he ate 15 quarts of oats a day -- and to keep the muscle from turning to fat , he needed fast workouts that could have won many a stakes race . Seth Hancock of Claiborne Farm once said , You want to know who Secretariat is in human terms ? Just imagine the greatest athlete in the world . The greatest . Now make him six - foot - three , the perfect height . Make him real intelligent and kind . And on top of that , make him the best - lookin ' guy ever to come down the pike . He was all those things as a horse . Racing career Racing colors of Meadow Stable Secretariat raced in Meadow Stables ' blue - and - white - checkered colors . He never raced in track bandages , but typically wore a blinker hood , mostly to help him focus , but also because he had a tendency to run in towards the rail during races . In January 1972 , he joined trainer Lucien Laurin 's winter stable at Hialeah . Secretariat gained a reputation as a kind horse , likeable and unruffled in crowds or by the bumping that occurs between young horses . He had the physique of a runner , but at first was awkward and clumsy . He was frequently outpaced by more precocious stable mates , running a quarter - mile in 26 seconds compared to 23 seconds by his peers . His regular exercise riders were Jim Gaffney and Charlie Davis . Davis was not initially impressed . `` He was a big fat sucker '' , Davis said . `` I mean , he was big . He was n't in a hurry to do nothin ' . He took his time . The quality was there , but he did n't show it until he wanted to . '' Gaffney though recalled his first ride on Secretariat in early 1972 as `` having this big red machine under me , and from that very first day I knew he had a power of strength that I have never felt before ... '' Groom Eddie Sweat was another important member of the Secretariat team , providing most of the daily hands - on care . Sweat once told a reporter , `` I guess a groom gets closer to a horse than anyone . The owner , the trainer , they maybe see him once a day . But I lived with him , worked with him . '' Laurin sent Chenery regular updates on Secretariat 's progress , saying that the colt was still learning to run , or that he still needed to lose his baby fat . Chenery recalled that when Secretariat was in training , Lucien once said : `` Your big Bold Ruler colt do n't show me nothin ' . He ca n't outrun a fat man . '' But Secretariat made steady progress over the spring . On June 6 , he wore blinkers for the first time to keep his attention focused and responded with a half - mile workout in a solid 47 ⁄ seconds . On June 24 , he ran a `` bullet '' , the fastest workout of the day , at 6 furlongs in 1 : 12 ⁄ on a sloppy track . Laurin called Chenery at her Colorado home and advised her that Secretariat was ready to race . 1972 : two - year - old season For his first start on July 4 , 1972 at Aqueduct Racetrack , Secretariat was made the lukewarm favorite at 3 -- 1 . At the start , a horse named Quebec cut in front of the field , causing a chain reaction that resulted in Secretariat being bumped hard . According to jockey Paul Feliciano , he would have fallen if he had n't been so strong . Secretariat recovered , only to run into traffic on the backstretch . In tenth position at the top of the stretch , he closed ground rapidly and finished fourth , beaten by only 1 ⁄ lengths . In many of his subsequent races , Secretariat hung back at the start , which Laurin later attributed to the bumping he received in his debut . With Feliciano again up , Secretariat returned to the track on July 15 as the 6 -- 5 favorite . He broke poorly , but then rushed past the field on the turn to win by six lengths . On July 31 in an allowance race at Saratoga , Feliciano was replaced by Ron Turcotte , the regular jockey for Meadow Stables . Turcotte had ridden the colt in several morning workouts , but had missed his first two starts while recovering from a fall . Secretariat 's commanding win as the 2 -- 5 favorite caught the attention of veteran sportswriter , Charles Hatton . He later reported , `` You carry an ideal around in your head , and boy , I thought , ' This is it . ' I never saw perfection before . I absolutely could not fault him in any way . And neither could the rest of them and that was the amazing thing about it . The body and the head and the eye and the general attitude . It was just incredible . I could n't believe my eyes , frankly . '' In August , Secretariat entered the Sanford Stakes , facing off with highly regarded Linda 's Chief . Entering the stretch , Secretariat was blocked by the horses in front of him but then made his way through `` like a hawk scattering a barnyard of chickens '' on his way to a three - length win . Sportswriter Andrew Beyer covered the race for the Washington Star and later wrote , `` Never have I watched a lightly raced 2 - year - old stamp himself so definitively as a potential great . '' Ten days later in the Hopeful Stakes , Secretariat made a `` dazzling '' move , passing eight horses within ⁄ mile to take the lead then drawing off to win by five lengths . His time of 1 : 16 ⁄ for 6 ⁄ furlongs was only ⁄ of a second off the track record . Returning to Belmont Park on September 16 , he won the Belmont Futurity by a length and a half after starting his move on the turn . He then ran in the Champagne Stakes at Belmont on October 14 as the 7 -- 10 favorite . As had become his custom , he started slowly and then made a big move around the turn , blowing past his rivals to win by two lengths . However , following an inquiry by the racecourse stewards , Secretariat was disqualified and placed second for bearing in and interfering with Stop the Music , who was declared the winner . Secretariat then took the Laurel Futurity on October 28 , winning by eight lengths over Stop the Music . His time on a sloppy track was just ⁄ of a second off the track record . He completed his season in the Garden State Futurity on November 18 , dropping back early and making a powerful move around the turn to win by 3 ⁄ lengths at 1 -- 10 odds . Laurin said , `` In all his races , he has taken the worst of it by coming from behind , usually circling his field . A colt has to be a real runner to do this consistently and get away with it . '' Secretariat won the Eclipse Award for American Champion Two - Year - Old Male Horse and , in a rare occurrence , two two - year - olds topped the balloting for 1972 American Horse of the Year honors , with Secretariat edging out the undefeated filly , La Prevoyante . Secretariat received the votes of the Thoroughbred Racing Associations of North America and the Daily Racing Form , while La Prevoyante was chosen by the National Turf Writers Association . Only one horse since then , Favorite Trick in 1997 , has won that award as a two - year - old . 1973 : three - year - old season In January 1973 , Christopher Chenery , the founder of Meadow Stables , died and the taxes on his estate forced his daughter Penny to consider selling Secretariat . Together with Seth Hancock of Claiborne Farm , she instead managed to syndicate the horse , selling 32 shares worth $190,000 each for a total of $6.08 million , a world syndication record at the time , surpassing the previous record for Nijinsky who was syndicated for $5.44 million in 1970 . Hancock said the sale was easy , citing Secretariat 's two - year - old performance , breeding , and appearance . `` He 's , well , he 's a hell of a horse . '' Chenery retained four shares in the horse and would have complete control over his three - year - old racing campaign , but agreed that he would be retired at the end of the year . Secretariat wintered in Florida but did not race until March 17 , 1973 in the Bay Shore Stakes at Aqueduct , where he went off as the heavy favorite . As the trainer of one of his opponents put it , `` The only chance we have is if he falls down . '' Racing boxed in by horses on each side , Turcotte decided to go through a narrow gap between horses rather than try to circle the field . Secretariat broke free and won easily , but one of the other jockeys claimed that Secretariat had committed a foul going through the hole . The stewards reviewed photos from the race and determined that Secretariat was actually on the receiving end of a bump , so let the result stand . The Bay Shore established that Secretariat had improved over the winter and that he could also handle adversity . In the Gotham Stakes on April 7 , Laurin decided to experiment with Secretariat 's running style . With no speed horses entered in the race , Secretariat would be allowed to set his own pace . Accordingly , Turcotte hustled Secretariat from the starting gate and they led easily . Down the stretch though , Champagne Charlie came running and at the eighth pole was almost even . Turcotte tapped Secretariat once on each side with the whip and Secretariat drew away to win by three lengths . He ran the first 3 / 4 mile in 1 : 08 ⁄ and finished the one - mile race in 1 : 33 ⁄ , matching the track record . His final preparatory race for the Kentucky Derby was the Wood Memorial , where he finished a surprising third to Angle Light and Santa Anita Derby winner Sham . Laurin was crushed , even though he had trained the winner , Angle Light , who set a slow pace and `` stole '' the race . Secretariat 's loss was later attributed to a large abscess in his mouth , which made him sensitive to the bit . Before and after the race , there was some ill feeling between Laurin and the trainer of Sham , Pancho Martin , fanned by comments in the press . The dispute centered around the use of coupled entries as Martin had entered two horses in addition to Sham , all with the same owner . There was fear that an entry could be used tactically to gang up on another horse . Stung by such insinuations , Martin wound up scratching the two horses that he had originally entered with Sham , and asked Lauren to do the same , but Laurin could not follow suit as Secretariat and Angle Light had different owners . Because of the Wood Memorial results , Secretariat 's chances in the Kentucky Derby became the subject of much speculation in the media . Some questioned his stamina : in part because of his `` blocky '' build , more typical of a sprinter , and in part because of Bold Ruler 's reputation as a sire of precocious sprinters . Rumors circulated that Secretariat was unsound . Kentucky Derby The 1973 Kentucky Derby on May 5 attracted a crowd of 134,476 to Churchill Downs , then the largest crowd in North American racing history . The bettors made the entry of Secretariat and Angle Light the 3 -- 2 favorite , with Sham the second choice at 5 -- 2 . The start was marred when Twice a Prince reared in his stall , hitting Our Native , positioned next to him , and causing Sham to bang his head against the gate , loosening two teeth . Sham then broke poorly and cut himself , also bumping into Navajo . Secretariat avoided problems by breaking last from post position 10 , then cut over to the rail . Early leader Shecky Greene set a reasonable pace , then gave way to Sham around the far turn . Secretariat came charging as they entered the stretch and battled with Sham down the stretch , finally pulling away to win by 2 ⁄ lengths . Our Native finished eight lengths further back in third . Secretariat at the Derby On his way to a still - standing track record of 1 : 59 ⁄ , Secretariat ran each quarter - mile segment faster than the one before it . The successive quarter - mile times were : 25 ⁄ , : 24 , : 23 ⁄ , : 23 ⁄ , and : 23 . This means he was still accelerating as of the final quarter - mile of the race . No other horse had won the Derby in less than 2 minutes before , and it would not be accomplished again until Monarchos ran the race in 1 : 59.97 in 2001 . Sportswriter Mike Sullivan later said : I was at Secretariat 's Derby , in ' 73 ... That was ... just beauty , you know ? He started in last place , which he tended to do . I was covering the second - place horse , which wound up being Sham . It looked like Sham 's race going into the last turn , I think . The thing you have to understand is that Sham was fast , a beautiful horse . He would have had the Triple Crown in another year . And it just did n't seem like there could be anything faster than that . Everybody was watching him . It was over , more or less . And all of a sudden there was this , like , just a disruption in the corner of your eye , in your peripheral vision . And then before you could make out what it was , here Secretariat came . And then Secretariat had passed him . No one had ever seen anything run like that -- a lot of the old guys said the same thing . It was like he was some other animal out there . Preakness Stakes Secretariat in the winner 's circle after the Preakness , with Ron Turcotte , Lucien Lauren , Eddie Sweat and Penny Chenery ( then Tweedy ) In the 1973 Preakness Stakes on May 19 , Secretariat broke last , but then made a huge , last - to - first move on the first turn . Raymond Woolfe , a photographer for the Daily Racing Form , captured Secretariat launching the move with a leaping stride in the air . This was later used as the basis for the statue by John Skeaping that stands in the Belmont Park paddock . Turcotte later said that he was proudest of this win because of the split - second decision he made going into the turn : `` I let my horse drop back , when I went to drop in , they started backing up into me . I said , ' I do n't want to get trapped here . ' So I just breezed by them . '' Secretariat completed the second quarter mile of the race in under 22 seconds . After reaching the lead with 5 ⁄ furlongs to go , Secretariat was never challenged , and won by 2 ⁄ lengths , with Sham again finishing second and Our Native in third , a further eight lengths back . It was the first time in history that the top three finishers in the Derby and Preakness were the same ; the distance between each of the horses was also the same . The time of the race was disputed . The infield teletimer displayed a time of 1 : 55 but it had malfunctioned because of damage caused by people crossing the track to reach the infield . The Pimlico Race Course clocker E.T. McLean Jr. announced a hand time of 1 : 54 ⁄ , but two Daily Racing Form clockers claimed the time was 1 : 53 ⁄ , which would have broken the track record of 1 : 54 set by Cañonero II . Tapes of Secretariat and Cañonero II were played side by side by CBS , and Secretariat got to the finish line first on tape , though this was not a reliable method of timing a horse race at the time . The Maryland Jockey Club , which managed the Pimlico racetrack and is responsible for maintaining Preakness records , discarded both the electronic and Daily Racing Form times and recognized the clocker 's 1 : 54 ⁄ as the official time ; however , the Daily Racing Form , for the first time in history , printed its own clocking of 1 : 53 ⁄ underneath the official time in the chart of the race . On June 19 , 2012 , a special meeting of the Maryland Racing Commission was convened at Laurel Park at the request of Penny Chenery , who hired companies to conduct a forensic review of the videotapes of the race . After over two hours of testimony , the commission unanimously voted to change the time of Secretariat 's win from 1 : 54 ⁄ to 1 : 53 , establishing a new stakes record . The Daily Racing Form announced that it would honor the commission 's ruling with regard to the running time . With the revised time , Sham also would have broken the old stakes record . As Secretariat prepared for the Belmont Stakes , he appeared on the covers of three national magazines : Time , Newsweek , and Sports Illustrated . He had become a national celebrity . William Nack wrote : `` Secretariat suddenly transcended horse racing and became a cultural phenomenon , a sort of undeclared national holiday from the tortures of Watergate and the Vietnam War . '' Chenery needed a secretary to handle all the fan mail and hired the William Morris Agency to manage public engagements . Secretariat responded to his fame by learning to pose for the camera . Belmont Stakes Only four horses ran against Secretariat for the June 9 Belmont Stakes , including Sham and three other horses thought to have little chance by the bettors : Twice A Prince , My Gallant , and Private Smiles . With so few horses in the race , and Secretariat expected to win , no `` show '' bets were taken . Secretariat was sent off as a 1 -- 10 favorite before a crowd of 69,138 , then the second largest attendance in Belmont history . The race was televised by CBS and was watched by over 15 million households , an audience share of 52 % . His only point of reference is himself . -- Charles Hatton On race day , the track was fast , and the weather was warm and sunny . Secretariat broke well on the rail and Sham rushed up beside him . The two ran the first quarter in a quick : 23 ⁄ and the next quarter in a swift : 22 ⁄ , completing the fastest opening half mile in the history of the race and opening ten lengths on the rest of the field . After the six - furlong mark , Sham began to tire , ultimately finishing last . Secretariat continued the fast pace and opened up a larger and larger margin on the field . His time for the mile was 1 : 34 ⁄ , over a second faster than the next fastest Belmont mile fraction in history , set by his sire Bold Ruler , who had eventually tired and finished third . Secretariat , however , did not falter . Turcotte said , `` This horse really paced himself . He is smart : I think he knew he was going 1 ⁄ miles , I never pushed him . '' In the stretch , Secretariat opened a lead of almost ⁄ of a mile on the rest of the field . At the finish , he won by 31 lengths , breaking the margin - of - victory record set by Triple Crown winner Count Fleet in 1943 of 25 lengths . CBS Television announcer Chic Anderson described the horse 's pace in a famous commentary : Secretariat is widening now ! He is moving like a tremendous machine ! The time for the race was not only a record , it was the fastest 1 ⁄ miles on dirt in history , 2 : 24 flat , breaking the stakes record by more than two seconds . Secretariat 's record still stands as an American record on the dirt . If the Beyer Speed Figure calculation had been developed during that time , Andrew Beyer calculated that Secretariat would have earned a figure of 139 , the highest he has ever assigned . A large crowd had started gathering around the paddock hours before the Belmont , many missing the races run earlier in the day for a chance to see the horses up close . Secretariat and Chenery were greeted with an enthusiasm that Chenery responded to with a wave or smile ; Secretariat was imperturbable . A large cheer went up at the break , but as the race went on , the two most commonly reported reactions were disbelief and fear that Secretariat had gone too fast . When it was clear that Secretariat would win , the sound reached a crescendo that reportedly made the grandstand shake . Blood - Horse magazine editor Kent Hollingsworth described the impact : `` Two twenty - four flat ! I do n't believe it . Impossible . But I saw it . I ca n't breathe . He won by a sixteenth of a mile ! I saw it . I have to believe it . '' The race is widely considered the greatest performance of the twentieth century by a North American racehorse . Secretariat became the ninth Triple Crown winner in history , and the first since Citation in 1948 , a gap of 25 years . Bettors holding 5,427 winning parimutuel tickets on Secretariat never redeemed them , presumably keeping them as souvenirs ( and because the tickets would have paid only $2.20 on a $2 bet ) . Arlington Invitational Three weeks after his win at Belmont , Secretariat was shipped to Arlington Park for the Arlington Invitational . Laurin explained : `` Even before the Belmont , you remember , I said I really did n't know how I could give this horse a rest . He 's so strong and full of energy . Well , this is only a week and a half after the Belmont , and believe me when I tell you , if I do n't run this horse he 's going to hurt himself in his stall . So we decided it would be nice to race him in Chicago to let the people in the Midwest have a chance to see him run . '' The race was run at 1 ⁄ miles with a purse of $125,000 . The challengers were grouped as a single betting entry at 6 -- 1 : Secretariat was 1 -- 20 ( the legal minimum ) and created a minus pool of $17,941 . Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago declared that the Saturday of the race was Secretariat Day . A crowd of 41,223 ( the largest at Arlington in three decades ) greeted his arrival on the track with sustained applause . Secretariat broke poorly but soon went to the lead , setting slow early fractions . He gathered momentum on the final turn and eventually won by nine lengths in 1 : 47 flat , just ⁄ off the track record set by Damascus . George Plimpton commented , `` With a better start , a horse to press him and less bow to his turns , Secretariat might have posted a time that would have stood a century . '' Whitney Stakes Secretariat next went to Saratoga , popularly nicknamed `` the graveyard of champions '' , in preparation for the Whitney Stakes on August 4 , where he would face older horses the first time . On July 27 , he put in a stunning workout of 1 : 34 for a mile on a sloppy track , a time that would have broken Saratoga 's track record . On race day though , he was beaten by the Allen Jerkens - trained Onion , a four - year - old gelding who had set a track record at 6 ⁄ furlongs in his previous start . The track condition for the Whitney was labelled fast but was running slow , especially along the inside rail . Secretariat broke poorly and Onion led from the start , setting a slow pace running well off the rail . Down the backstretch , Turcotte chose to make his move along the rail rather than sweeping wide . Secretariat responded more sluggishly than usual and Turcotte went to the whip . Secretariat closed to within a head on the final turn before Onion pulled ahead in the straight to win by a length . A record crowd of more than 30,000 witnessed what was described as an `` astonishing '' upset . Despite Jerkens 's reputation as the `` Giant Killer , '' Secretariat 's stunning loss can possibly be attributed to a viral infection , which caused a low - grade fever and diarrhea . `` I was learning then that anything could happen in horse racing '' , said Chenery . `` We knew he had a low - grade infection . But we decided he was strong enough to win anyway , and we were wrong . '' Secretariat lost his appetite and acted sluggishly for several days . Charles Hatton wrote : `` He seemed distressingly ill walking off , and he missed the Travers . Returned to Belmont to point for the $250,000 Marlboro , the sport 's pin - up horse looked bloody awful , rather like one of those sick paintings which betoken an inner theatre of the macabre . It required supernatural recuperative powers to recover as he did . He was subjected to four severe preps in two weeks . Astonishingly , he gained weight and blossomed with every trial . '' Marlboro Cup On September 15 , Secretariat returned to Belmont Park in the inaugural Marlboro Cup , which was originally intended to be a match race with stablemate Riva Ridge , the 1972 Derby and Belmont Stakes winner . After Secretariat 's loss in the Whitney , the field was expanded to invite top horses from across the country . Entries included 1972 turf champion and top California stakes winner Cougar II , Canadian champion Kennedy Road , 1972 American champion three - year - old colt Key to the Mint , Travers winner Annihilate ' Em ( the only other three - year - old in the race ) , and Onion . Riva Ridge was assigned top weight of 127 pounds ( one pound over the weight - for - age scale ) , Key to the Mint and Cougar II were at 126 pounds , scale weight , while Secretariat was at 124 , three pounds over scale for his age . The field included five champions , and the seven starters had won 63 stakes races between them . It rained the night before , but the track dried out by race time . Secretariat stalked a fast pace in fifth , while Riva Ridge rated just behind Onion and Kennedy Road . Around the turn , Secretariat raced wide and started to make up ground . Coming into the stretch , Secretariat overtook Riva Ridge , while the other early leaders dropped back . Secretariat drew away to win , completing 1 ⁄ miles in 1 : 45 ⁄ , then a world record on the dirt for the distance . Riva Ridge ran second with Cougar II in third and Onion in fourth . Turcotte said , `` Today he was the old Secretariat and he did it on his own . '' The purse for the Marlboro Cup was $250,000 , then the highest prize money offered : the win made Secretariat the 13th Thoroughbred millionaire in history . Woodward Stakes After the Marlboro Cup , the original plan was to enter Riva Ridge in the 1 ⁄ mile Woodward Stakes , just two weeks later , while Secretariat put in some slow workouts on the turf in preparation for the Man o ' War Stakes in October . It rained before the Woodward and the track was sloppy , which Riva Ridge could not handle , so Secretariat was entered in his place . Secretariat led into the straight but was overtaken by the Allen Jerkens - trained four - year - old Prove Out , who pulled clear to win by 4 ⁄ lengths . Prove Out ran the race of his life that day : his time was the second - fastest mile - and - a-half on the dirt in Belmont history despite the sloppy conditions . Prove Out went on to beat Riva Ridge in that year 's Jockey Club Gold Cup . Man o ' War Stakes On October 8 , just nine days after the Woodward , Secretariat was moved to turf for the Man O ' War Stakes at a distance of 1 ⁄ miles . He faced Tentam , who had set a world record for 1 ⁄ miles on the turf earlier that summer , and five others . Secretariat went to the lead early , followed by Tentam , who gradually closed the gap down the backstretch . Tentam got to within a half - length before Secretariat responded , pulling away by three lengths . Tentam made another run around the far turn , but Secretariat again drew away , eventually winning by five lengths over Tentam , with Big Spruce seven and a half lengths further back in third . Secretariat set a course record time of 2 : 24 ⁄ . After the race , Ron Turcotte explained that `` when Tentam came up to him in the backstretch I just chirped to him and he pulled away '' . Canadian International Stakes The syndication deal for Secretariat precluded the horse racing past age three . Accordingly , Secretariat 's last race was against older horses in the Canadian International Stakes over one and five - eighths miles on the turf at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto , Ontario , Canada on October 28 , 1973 . The race was chosen in part because of long - time ties between E.P. Taylor and the Chenery family , and partly to honor Secretariat 's Canadian connections , Laurin and Turcotte . Unfortunately , Turcotte missed the race with a five - day suspension : Eddie Maple got the mount . The day of the race was cold , windy and wet , but the Marshall turf course was firm . Despite the weather , some 35,000 people turned out to greet Secretariat in a `` virtual hysteria '' that Secretariat seemed not to notice . His biggest opponents were Kennedy Road , who he had already beaten in the Marlboro Cup , and Big Spruce , who had finished third in the Man o ' War . Kennedy Road went to the early lead , while Secretariat moved to second after breaking from an outside post . On the backstretch , Secretariat made his move and forged to the lead . `` Snorting steam in the raw twilight '' , he rounded the far turn with a 12 - length lead before gearing down in the final furlong , ultimately winning by 6 ⁄ lengths . Once again , many winning tickets went uncashed by souvenir hunters . After the race , Secretariat was brought to Aqueduct Racetrack where he was paraded with Turcotte dressed in the Meadow silks before a crowd of 32,990 in his final public appearance . `` It 's a sad day , and yet it 's a great day '' , said Laurin . `` I certainly wish he could run as a 4 - year - old . He 's a great horse and he loves to run . '' Altogether , Secretariat won 16 of his 21 career races , with three seconds and one third , and total earnings of $1,316,808 . For 1973 , Secretariat was again named Horse of the Year , and won Eclipse Awards as the American Champion Three - Year - Old Male Horse and the American Champion Male Turf Horse . Retirement Stud career When Secretariat first retired to Claiborne Farm , his sperm showed some signs of immaturity , so he was bred to three non-Thoroughbred mares in December 1973 to test his fertility . One of these , an Appaloosa named Leola , produced Secretariat 's first foal in November 1974 . Named First Secretary , the foal was a chestnut like his sire , but spotted like his dam . Secretariat 's first official foal crop , arriving in 1975 , consisted of 28 foals , the best of which was Dactylographer , who won the William Hill Futurity in October 1977 . The first crop also included Canadian Bound , who at the 1976 Keeneland July sale was the first yearling to break the $1 million barrier , selling for $1.5 million . Canadian Bound , however , was a complete failure in racing , and for several years , the value of Secretariat 's offspring declined considerably , especially given the rising popularity of Northern Dancer 's offspring in the sales ring . Secretariat eventually sired a number of major stakes winners , including : General Assembly , winner of the 1979 Travers Stakes , setting a track record of 2 : 00 flat that stood for 37 years . Lady 's Secret , 1986 Horse of the Year . Risen Star , 1988 Preakness and Belmont Stakes winner . Kingston Rule , 1990 Melbourne Cup winner , breaking the course record . Tinners Way , born in 1990 to Secretariat 's last crop , winner of the 1994 and 1995 Pacific Classic . Ultimately , Secretariat officially sired 663 named foals , including 341 winners ( 51.4 % ) and 54 stakes winners ( 8.1 % ) . There has been some criticism of Secretariat as a stallion , mainly because he did not produce male offspring of his own ability and did not leave a leading sire son behind , but his legacy is assured though the quality of his daughters , several of whom were excellent racers and even more of whom were excellent producers . In 1992 , Secretariat was the leading broodmare sire in North America . Overall , Secretariat 's daughters produced 24 Grade / Group 1 winners . As a broodmare sire , Secretariat 's most notable progeny were : Weekend Surprise , a stakes winner and the 1992 Kentucky Broodmare of the Year . Her sons include 1990 Preakness winner Summer Squall and 1992 Horse of the Year A.P. Indy . Terlingua , a stakes winner and dam of leading sire Storm Cat . Secrettame , a stakes winner and dam of important sire Gone West , whose descendants include Kentucky Derby winner Smarty Jones . Six Crowns , dam of champion two - year - old and sire Chief 's Crown . Sister Dot , dam of champion two - year - old and sire Dehere . Celtic Assembly , dam of Volksraad , leading sire in New Zealand . Betty 's Secret , dam of Secreto , winner of The Derby , and Istabraq , three - time winner of the Champion Hurdle . Through Weekend Surprise and Terlingua alone , Secretariat appears in the pedigree of numerous champions . Weekend Surprises 's son A.P. Indy was the leading sire in North America in 2003 and 2006 , and is the sire of 2003 Horse of the Year Mineshaft and 2007 Belmont Stakes winner Rags to Riches . He has also established a successful sire - line that leads to Kentucky Derby winners Orb and California Chrome . A.P. Indy 's leading sire - line descendant is Tapit , who led the sire list in 2014 -- 2015 and is the sire of Belmont Stakes winners Tonalist and Creator . Terlingua 's son Storm Cat is also a two time leading sire , whose offspring include Giant 's Causeway , three - time leading sire in North America . Storm Cat also sired Yankee Gentleman , who is the broodmare sire of 2015 Triple Crown winner American Pharoah . Inbreeding to Secretariat has also proven successful , as exemplified by numerous graded stakes winners , including two - time Horse of the Year Wise Dan , as well as sprint champion Speightstown . Secretariat 's paddock at Claiborne Farm bordered three other stallions : Drone , Sir Ivor , and Hall of Fame inductee Spectacular Bid . Secretariat did not pay much attention to Drone or Sir Ivor , but he and Spectacular Bid became friendly and occasionally raced each other along the fence line between their paddocks . Death In the fall of 1989 , Secretariat became afflicted with laminitis -- a painful and debilitating hoof condition . When his condition failed to improve after a month of treatment , he was euthanized on October 4 at the age of 19 . Secretariat was buried at Claiborne Farm , given the rare honor of being buried whole ( usually only the head , heart , and hooves of a winning race horse are buried ) . At the time of Secretariat 's death , the veterinarian who performed the necropsy , Dr. Thomas Swerczek , head pathologist at the University of Kentucky , did not weigh Secretariat 's heart , but stated , `` We just stood there in stunned silence . We could n't believe it . The heart was perfect . There were no problems with it . It was just this huge engine . '' Later , Swerczek also performed a necropsy on Sham , who died in 1993 . Swerczek did weigh Sham 's heart , and it was 18 pounds ( 8.2 kg ) . Based on Sham 's measurement , and having necropsied both horses , he estimated Secretariat 's heart probably weighed 22 pounds ( 10.0 kg ) , or about 2.5 times that of the average horse ( 8.5 pounds ( 3.9 kg ) ) . An extremely large heart is a trait that occasionally occurs in Thoroughbreds , hypothesized to be linked to a genetic condition , called the `` x-factor '' , passed down in specific inheritance patterns . The x-factor can be traced to the historic racehorse Eclipse , who was necropsied after his death in 1789 . Because Eclipse 's heart appeared to be much larger than other horses , it was weighed , and found to be 14 pounds ( 6.4 kg ) , almost twice the normal weight . Eclipse is believed to have passed the trait on via his daughters , and pedigree research verified that Secretariat traces in his dam line to a daughter of Eclipse . Secretariat 's success as a broodmare sire has been linked by some to this large heart theory . However , it has not been proven whether the x-factor exists , let alone increases athletic ability . Honors and recognition The Secretariat statue at Belmont Park is modeled after Secretariat 's leaping stride during the Preakness . Secretariat was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1974 , the year following his Triple Crown victory . Also in 1974 , Paul Mellon commissioned a bronze statue , sometimes known as Secretariat in Full Stride , from John Skeaping . The life - size statue remained in the center of the walking ring at Belmont Park until 1988 when it was replaced by a replica . The original is now located at the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame . The Kentucky Horse Park has two other life - sized statues of Secretariat . The first , created by Jim Reno in 1992 , shows Secretariat as an older sire , while the second , completed by Edwin Bogucki in 2004 , shows him being led into the winner 's circle after the Kentucky Derby . In 2015 , a new statue of Secretariat and Ron Turcotte crossing the finish line at the Belmont Stakes was unveiled in Grand Falls , New Brunswick , Turcotte 's hometown . In 1994 , Sports Illustrated ranked Secretariat # 17 in their list of the 40 greatest sports figures of the past 40 years . In 1999 , ESPN listed him 35th of the 100 greatest North American athletes of the 20th century , the highest of three non-humans on the list ( the other two were also racehorses : Man o ' War at 84th and Citation at 97th ) . Secretariat ranked second behind Man o ' War in The Blood - Horse 's List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century . He was also ranked second behind Man o ' War by both a six - member panel of experts assembled by the Associated Press , and a Sports Illustrated panel of seven experts . On October 16 , 1999 in a ceremony conducted in the winner 's circle at Keeneland Race Course in Lexington , the U.S. Postal Service honored Secretariat with a 33 - cent postage stamp bearing his image . In 2005 , Secretariat was featured in ESPN Classic 's show `` Who 's No. 1 ? '' in the episode `` Greatest Sports Performances '' . He was the only nonhuman on the list , with his run at Belmont ranking second behind Wilt Chamberlain 's 100 - point game . On May 2 , 2007 , Secretariat was inducted into the Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame , marking the first time an animal received this honor . In 2013 , Secretariat was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in honor of his victory in the Canadian International 40 years earlier . Secretariat was also the focus of a 2013 segment of 60 Minutes Sports . In March 2016 , Secretariat 's Triple Crown victory was rated # 13 in the Sports Illustrated listing of the 100 Greatest Moments in Sports History . Due to Secretariat 's enduring popularity , Chenery remained a prominent figure in racing and a powerful advocate for Thoroughbred aftercare and veterinary research until her death in 2017 . In 2004 , the Maker 's Mark Secretariat Center , dedicated to reschooling former racehorses and matching them to new homes , opened at the Kentucky Horse Park . In 2010 , Chenery developed the Secretariat Vox Populi ( `` voice of the people '' ) Award , which is voted for by racing fans . It is intended to acknowledge `` the horse whose popularity and racing excellence best resounded with the American public and gained recognition for Thoroughbred racing . '' The consideration of the racing fan 's engagement is what distinguishes the Vox Populi award from others . The first honoree in 2010 was Zenyatta , that year 's Horse of the Year , while the second award went to Rapid Redux , a former claimer who went on to win 22 consecutive races at smaller racetracks . Paynter received the 2012 award for his battle with laminitis , the same condition that led to Secretariat 's death . `` Paynter 's popularity stems from his ability to battle and exceed expectations , making him the perfect choice as the recipient of this year 's Vox Populi Award '' , said Chenery . `` After seeing firsthand the devastating effects of this disease , I am even more convinced that the industry must continue to diligently fight laminitis . The progress we have made to date clearly benefited Paynter -- a beautiful colt with a tremendous spirit . '' The Secretariat Stakes was created in 1974 to honor his appearance at Arlington Park in 1973 . The Meadow , the farm at which he was born , was listed on the National Register of Historic Places . It is now known as The Meadow Historic District . Secretariat , a Disney live - action film about the racing career of Secretariat , written by Mike Rich and directed by Randall Wallace , was released on October 8 , 2010 .

Pedigree Secretariat was by Bold Ruler , who led the North America sire list eight times , more than any other stallion in the 20th century . He also led the juvenile ( two - year - old ) sire list a record six times . Before Secretariat 's Triple Crown run , Bold Ruler was often categorized as a sire of precocious juveniles that lacked stamina or did not train on past age two . However , even before Secretariat , Bold Ruler actually had sired 11 stakes winners of races at 10 furlongs or more . Ultimately , seven of the ten Kentucky Derby winners in the 1970s traced directly to Bold Ruler in their tail male lines , including Secretariat and fellow Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew . Secretariat 's dam was Somethingroyal , the 1973 Kentucky Broodmare of the Year . Although Somethingroyal was unplaced in her only start , she had an excellent pedigree . Her sire Princequillo was the leading broodmare sire from 1966 to 1970 and was noted as a source of stamina and soundness . Her dam Imperatrice was a stakes winner who was purchased by Christopher Chenery at a dispersal sale in 1947 for $30,000 . Imperatrice produced several stakes winners and stakes producers for the Meadow . Prior to foaling Secretariat at age 18 , Somethingroyal had already produced Sir Gaylord , a stakes winner who became an important sire , whose offspring included Epsom Derby winner Sir Ivor . Somethingroyal 's other stakes winners were First Family , Sir Gaylord and Syrian Sea . Breeders speak of a ' nick '' occurring when a sire or grandsire produces significantly better offspring from the daughters of one particular sire than with mares from other bloodlines . The breeding of Bold Ruler with Somethingroyal is an example of a famous nick between Bold Ruler 's sire Nasrullah and daughters of Princequillo . The goal was to balance the speed , precocity , and fiery temperament provided by the Nasrullah side of the pedigree with Princequillo 's stamina , soundness , and sensible temperament .

            "Document Text: Chariot - wikipedia Chariot Jump to : navigation , search For other uses , see Chariot ( disambiguation ) . A chariot drawn by horses Approximate historical map of the spread of the spoke - wheeled chariot , 1670 -- 500 BC A chariot is a type of carriage driven by a charioteer using primarily horses to provide rapid motive power . Chariots were used by armies as transport or mobile archery platforms , for hunting or for racing , and as a conveniently fast way to travel for many ancient people . The word `` chariot '' comes from the Latin term carrus , a loanword from Gaulish . A chariot of war or one used in military parades was called a car . In ancient Rome and some other ancient Mediterranean civilizations , a biga required two horses , a triga three , and a quadriga four . The horse chariot was a fast , light , open , two - wheeled conveyance drawn by two or more horses that were hitched side by side , and was little more than a floor with a waist - high guard at the front and sides . It was initially used for ancient warfare during the Bronze and Iron Ages ; but , after its military capabilities had been superseded by cavalry , as horses were gradually bred to be bigger , the chariot was used for travel , in processions , for games , and in races . The critical invention that allowed the construction of light , horse - drawn chariots was the spoked wheel . The earliest spoke - wheeled chariots date to ca . 2000 BC . The use of chariots peaked around 1300 BC ( see Battle of Kadesh ) . Chariots had lost their military importance by the 1st century AD , but chariot races continued to be popular in Constantinople until the 6th century .

( Archeologists have not found earlier horse bones in the area . ) During the Kura - Araxes period , horses seem to become quite widespread , with signs of domestication . Eastern Europe ( edit ) The domestication of the horse was an important step toward civilization . An increasing amount of evidence supports the hypothesis , that horses were domesticated in the Eurasian Steppes ( Dereivka in Ukraine ) approximately 4000 - 3500 BC . The invention of the wheel used in transportation most likely took place in Mesopotamia or the Eurasian steppes in modern - day Ukraine . Evidence of wheeled vehicles appears from the mid 4th millennium BC near - simultaneously in the Northern Caucasus ( Maykop culture ) , and in Central Europe . The earliest vehicles may have been ox carts . Starokorsunskaya kurgan in the Kuban region of Russia contains a wagon grave ( or chariot burial ) of the Maikop Culture ( which also had horses ) . The two solid wooden wheels from this kurgan have been dated to the second half of the fourth millennium . Soon thereafter the number of such burials in this Northern Caucasus region multiplied . As David Anthony writes in his book The Horse , the Wheel and Language , in Eastern Europe , the earliest well - dated depiction of a wheeled vehicle ( a wagon with two axles and four wheels ) is on the Bronocice pot ( c. 3500 BC ) . It is a clay pot excavated in a Funnelbeaker settlement in Swietokrzyskie Voivodeship in Poland . The oldest securely dated real wheel - axle combination in Eastern Europe is the Ljubljana Marshes Wheel ( c. 3150 BC ) . Later developments in Europe ( edit ) A mosaic of the Kasta Tomb in Amphipolis depicting the abduction of Persephone by Pluto , 4th century BC The goddess Nike riding on a two - horse chariot , from an Apulian patera ( tray ) , Magna Graecia , 4th century BC . Greece ( edit ) The earliest records of chariots are the arsenal inventories of the palacial centres in Mycenaean Greece , as described in Linear B tablets from the 15th - 14th centuries BC . The tablets distinguish between `` assembled '' and `` dismantled '' chariots . The latter Greeks of the first millennium BC had a ( still not very effective ) cavalry arm , and the rocky terrain of the Greek mainland was unsuited for wheeled vehicles . Consequently , in historical Greece the chariot was never used to any extent in war . Nevertheless , the chariot retained a high status and memories of its era were handed down in epic poetry . Linear B tablets from Mycenaean palaces record large inventories of chariots , sometimes with specific details as to how many chariots were assembled or not ( i.e. stored in modular form ) . Later the vehicles were used in games and processions , notably for races at the Olympic and Panathenaic Games and other public festivals in ancient Greece , in hippodromes and in contests called agons . They were also used in ceremonial functions , as when a paranymph , or friend of a bridegroom , went with him in a chariot to fetch the bride home . Herodotus ( Histories , 5 . 9 ) Reports that chariots were widely used in the Pontic -- Caspian steppe by the Sigynnae . Procession of chariots on a Late Geometric amphora from Athens ( ca . 720 -- 700 BC ) Greek chariots were made to be drawn by two horses attached to a central pole . If two additional horses were added , they were attached on each side of the main pair by a single bar or trace fastened to the front or prow of the chariot , as may be seen on two prize vases in the British Museum from the Panathenaic Games at Athens , Greece , in which the driver is seated with feet resting on a board hanging down in front close to the legs of the horses . The biga itself consists of a seat resting on the axle , with a rail at each side to protect the driver from the wheels . Greek chariots appear to have lacked any other attachment for the horses , which would have made turning difficult . The body or basket of the chariot rested directly on the axle ( called beam ) connecting the two wheels . There was no suspension , making this an uncomfortable form of transport . At the front and sides of the basket was a semicircular guard about 3 ft ( 1 m ) high , to give some protection from enemy attack . At the back the basket was open , making it easy to mount and dismount . There was no seat , and generally only enough room for the driver and one passenger . The Charioteer of Delphi was dedicated to the god Apollo in 474 BC by the tyrant of Gela in commemoration of a Pythian racing victory at Delphi The reins were mostly the same as those in use in the 19th century , and were made of leather and ornamented with studs of ivory or metal . The reins were passed through rings attached to the collar bands or yoke , and were long enough to be tied round the waist of the charioteer to allow for defense . The wheels and basket of the chariot were usually of wood , strengthened in places with bronze or iron . They had from four to eight spokes and tires of bronze or iron . Due to the widely spaced spokes , the rim of the chariot wheel was held in tension over comparatively large spans . Whilst this provided a small measure of shock absorption , it also necessitated the removal of the wheels when the chariot was not in use , to prevent warping from continued weight bearing . Most other nations of this time had chariots of similar design to the Greeks , the chief differences being the mountings . According to Greek mythology , the chariot was invented by Erichthonius of Athens to conceal his feet , which were those of a dragon . The most notable appearance of the chariot in Greek mythology occurs when Phaëton , the son of Helios , in an attempt to drive the chariot of the sun , managed to set the earth on fire . This story led to the archaic meaning of a phaeton as one who drives a chariot or coach , especially at a reckless or dangerous speed . Plato , in his Chariot Allegory , depicted a chariot drawn by two horses , one well behaved and the other troublesome , representing opposite impulses of human nature ; the task of the charioteer , representing reason , was to stop the horses from going different ways and to guide them towards enlightenment . The Greek word for chariot , ἅρμα , hárma , is also used nowadays to denote a tank , properly called άρμα μάχης , árma mákhēs , literally a `` combat chariot '' . Northern Europe ( edit ) A petroglyph in a double burial , c. 1000 BC ( the Nordic Bronze Age ) The Trundholm sun chariot is dated to c. 1400 BC ( see Nordic Bronze Age ) . The horse drawing the solar disk runs on four wheels , and the Sun itself on two . All wheels have four spokes . The `` chariot '' comprises the solar disk , the axle , and the wheels , and it is unclear whether the sun is depicted as the chariot or as the passenger . Nevertheless , the presence of a model of a horse - drawn vehicle on two spoked wheels in Northern Europe at such an early time is astonishing . In addition to the Trundholm chariot , there are numerous petroglyphs from the Nordic Bronze Age that depict chariots . One petroglyph , drawn on a stone slab in a double burial from c. 1000 BC , depicts a biga with two four - spoked wheels . The use of the composite bow in chariot warfare is not attested in northern Europe . Western Europe and British isles ( edit ) The Celts were famous for their chariots and modern English words like car , carriage and carry are ultimately derived from the native Brythonic language ( Modern Welsh : Cerbyd ) . The word chariot itself is derived from the Norman French charriote and shares a Celtic root ( Gaulish : karros ) . Some 20 iron - aged chariot burials have been excavated in Britain , roughly dating from between 500 BC and 100 BC . Virtually all of them were found in East Yorkshire - the exception was a find in 2001 in Newbridge , 10 km west of Edinburgh . The Celtic chariot , which may have been called karbantos in Gaulish ( compare Latin carpentum ) , was a biga that measured approximately 2 m ( 6.56 ft ) in width and 4 m ( 13 ft ) in length . British chariots were open in front . Julius Caesar provides the only significant eyewitness report of British chariot warfare : Their mode of fighting with their chariots is this : firstly , they drive about in all directions and throw their weapons and generally break the ranks of the enemy with the very dread of their horses and the noise of their wheels ; and when they have worked themselves in between the troops of horse , leap from their chariots and engage on foot . The charioteers in the meantime withdraw some little distance from the battle , and so place themselves with the chariots that , if their masters are overpowered by the number of the enemy , they may have a ready retreat to their own troops . Thus they display in battle the speed of horse , ( together with ) the firmness of infantry ; and by daily practice and exercise attain to such expertness that they are accustomed , even on a declining and steep place , to check their horses at full speed , and manage and turn them in an instant and run along the pole , and stand on the yoke , and thence betake themselves with the greatest celerity to their chariots again . Chariots play an important role in Irish mythology surrounding the hero Cú Chulainn . Sculpture by Thomas Thornycroft of Boudica and her daughters in her chariot , addressing her troops before the battle Procession of chariots and warriors on the Vix krater ( c. 510 ) , a vessel of Archaic Greek workmanship found in a Gallic burial Chariots could also be used for ceremonial purposes . According to Tacitus ( Annals 14.35 ) , Boudica , queen of the Iceni and a number of other tribes in a formidable uprising against the occupying Roman forces , addressed her troops from a chariot in 61 AD : `` Boudicca curru filias prae se vehens , ut quamque nationem accesserat , solitum quidem Britannis feminarum ductu bellare testabatur '' Boudicca , with her daughters before her in a chariot , went up to tribe after tribe , protesting that it was indeed usual for Britons to fight under the leadership of women . The last mention of chariot use in battle seems to be at the Battle of Mons Graupius , somewhere in modern Scotland , in 84 AD . From Tacitus ( Agricola 1.35 -- 36 ) `` The plain between resounded with the noise and with the rapid movements of chariots and cavalry . '' The chariots did not win even their initial engagement with the Roman auxiliaries : `` Meantime the enemy 's cavalry had fled , and the charioteers had mingled in the engagement of the infantry . '' Modern reconstruction of a Hussite war wagon Later through the centuries , the chariot , became commonly known as the `` war wagon '' . The `` war wagon '' was a medieval development used to attack rebel or enemy forces on battle fields . The wagon was given slits for archers to shoot enemy targets , supported by infantry using pikes and flails and later for the invention of gunfire by hand - gunners ; side walls were use for protection against archers , crossbowmen , the early use of gunpowder and cannon fire . It was especially useful during the Hussite Wars , ca . 1420 , by Hussite forces rebelling in Bohemia . Groups of them could form defensive works , but they also were used as hardpoints for Hussite formations or as firepower in pincer movements . This early use of gunpowder and innovative tactics helped a largely peasant infantry stave off attacks by the Holy Roman Empire 's larger forces of mounted knights . Etruria ( edit ) Detail of the Monteleone Chariot at the Met ( c. 530 BC ) The only intact Etruscan chariot dates to c. 530 BC and was uncovered as part of a chariot burial at Monteleone di Spoleto . Currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art , it is decorated with bronze plates decorated with detailed low - relief scenes , commonly interpreted as depicting episodes from the life of Achilles . Urartu ( edit ) In Urartu ( 860 -- 590 BC ) , the chariot was used by both the nobility and the military . In Erebuni ( Yerevan ) , King Argishti of Urartu is depicted riding on a chariot which is dragged by two horses . The chariot has two wheels and each wheel has about eight spokes . This type of chariot was used around 800 BC . Rome ( edit ) A winner of a Roman chariot race In the Roman Empire , chariots were not used for warfare , but for chariot racing , especially in circuses , or for triumphal processions , when they could be drawn by as many as ten horses or even by dogs , tigers , or ostriches . There were four divisions , or factiones , of charioteers , distinguished by the colour of their costumes : the red , blue , green and white teams . The main centre of chariot racing was the Circus Maximus , situated in the valley between the Palatine and Aventine Hills in Rome . The track could hold 12 chariots , and the two sides of the track were separated by a raised median termed the spina . Chariot races continued to enjoy great popularity in Byzantine times , in the Hippodrome of Constantinople , even after the Olympic Games had been disbanded , until their decline after the Nika riots in the 6th century . The starting gates were known as the Carceres . An ancient Roman car or chariot drawn by four horses abreast together with the horses drawing it was called a Quadriga , from the Latin quadriugi ( of a team of four ) . The term sometimes meant instead the four horses without the chariot or the chariot alone . A three - horse chariot , or the three - horse team drawing it , was a triga , from triugi ( of a team of three ) . A two - horse chariot , or the two - horse team drawing it , was a biga , from biugi . Ancient Near East ( edit ) Some scholars argue that the horse chariot was most likely a product of the ancient Near East early in the 2nd millennium BCE . Archaeologist Joost Crouwel writes that `` Chariots were not sudden inventions , but developed out of earlier vehicles that were mounted on disk or cross-bar wheels . This development can best be traced in the Near East , where spoke - wheeled and horse - drawn chariots are first attested in the earlier part of the second millennium BCE ... '' and were illustrated on a Syrian cylinder seal dated to either the 18th or 17th century BC . Early wheeled vehicles in the Near East ( edit ) Relief of early war wagons on the Standard of Ur , c. 2500 BC It is widely believed that wheeled transport was invented in Mesopotamia . Nevertheless , recent archaeological evidence seems to indicate otherwise , pointing to Neolithic Europe . According to Christoph Baumer , the earliest discoveries of wheels in Mesopotamia come from the first half of the third millennium BC -- more than half a millennium later than the first finds from the Kuban region . At the same time , in Mesopotamia , some intriguing early pictograms of a sled that rests on wooden rollers or wheels have been found . They date from about the same time as the early wheel discoveries in Europe and may indicate knowledge of the wheel . The earliest fully developed spoke - wheeled horse chariots are from the chariot burials of the Andronovo ( Timber - Grave ) sites of the Sintashta - Petrovka Proto - Indo - Iranian culture in modern Russia and Kazakhstan from around 2000 BC . This culture is at least partially derived from the earlier Yamna culture . It built heavily fortified settlements , engaged in bronze metallurgy on an industrial scale and practiced complex burial rituals reminiscent of Hindu rituals known from the Rigveda and the Avesta . Over the next few centuries , the Andronovo culture spread across the steppes from the Urals to the Tien Shan , likely corresponding to the time of early Indo - Iranian cultures . Chariots figure prominently in Indo - Iranian mythology . Chariots are also an important part of both Hindu and Persian mythology , with most of the gods in their pantheon portrayed as riding them . The Sanskrit word for a chariot is rátha - ( m . ) , which is cognate with Avestan raθa - ( also m . ) , and in origin a substantiation of the adjective Proto - Indo - European * rot - h2 - ó - meaning `` having wheels '' , with the characteristic accent shift found in Indo - Iranian substantivisations . This adjective is in turn derived from the collective noun * rot - eh2 - `` wheels '' , continued in Latin rota , which belongs to the noun * rót - o - for `` wheel '' ( from * ret - `` to run '' ) that is also found in Germanic , Celtic and Baltic ( Old High German rad n. , Old Irish roth m. , Lithuanian rãtas m . ) . The earliest depiction of vehicles in the context of warfare is on the Standard of Ur in southern Mesopotamia , c. 2500 BCE . These are more properly called wagons or carts and were double - axled and pulled by oxen or a hybrid of a donkey and a female onager , named Kunga in the city of Nagar which was famous for breeding them . The hybrids were used by the Eblaite , early Sumerian , Akkadian and Ur III armies . Although sometimes carrying a spearman with the charioteer ( driver ) , such heavy wagons , borne on solid wooden wheels and covered with skins , may have been part of the baggage train ( e.g. , during royal funeral processions ) rather than vehicles of battle in themselves . The Sumerians had a lighter , two - wheeled type of cart , pulled by four asses , and with solid wheels . The spoked wheel did not appear in Mesopotamia until the mid-2000s BCE . The area of the spoke - wheeled chariot finds within the Sintashta - Petrovka Proto - Indo - Iranian culture is indicated in purple . Ancient canaan and israel ( edit ) See also : Merkabah Chariots are frequently mentioned in the Hebrew Tanakh and the Greek Old Testament , respectively , particularly by the prophets , as instruments of war or as symbols of power or glory . First mentioned in the story of Joseph ( Genesis 50 : 9 ) , `` Iron chariots '' are mentioned also in Joshua ( 17 : 16 , 18 ) and Judges ( 1 : 19 , 4 : 3 , 13 ) as weapons of the Canaanites and Israelites. 1 Samuel 13 : 5 mentions chariots of the Philistines , who are sometimes identified with the Sea Peoples or early Greeks . Examples from The Jewish Study Bible of Tanakh ( Jewish Bible ) include : Isaiah 2 : 7 Their land is full of silver and gold , there is no limit to their treasures ; their land is full of horses , there is no limit to their chariots . Jeremiah 4 : 13 Lo , he ( I.e. , the invader of v. 7 . ) ascends like clouds , his chariots are like a whirlwind , his horses are swifter than eagles . Woe to us , we are ruined ! Ezekiel 26 : 10 From the cloud raised by his horses dust shall cover you ; from the clatter of horsemen and wheels and chariots , your walls shall shake − when he enters your gates as men enter a breached city . Psalms 20 : 8 They ( call ) on chariots , they ( call ) on horses , but we call on the name of the LORD our God . Song of Songs 1 : 9 I have likened you , my darling , to a mare in Pharaoh 's chariots Examples from the King James Version of Christian Bible include : 2 Chronicles 1 : 14 And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen : and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen , which he placed in the chariot cities , and with the king at Jerusalem . Judges 1 : 19 And the LORD was with Judah ; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain ; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron . Acts 8 : 37 -- 38 Then Philip said , `` If you believe with all your heart , you may . '' And he answered and said , `` I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God . '' So he commanded the chariot to stand still . And both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water , and he baptized him . Jezreel ( city ) has been identified as the chariot base of King Ahab . And the decorated lynchpin of Sisera 's chariot was identified at a site identified as his fortress Harosheth Haggoyim . Egypt ( edit ) Main article : Chariotry in ancient Egypt Ramses II fighting from a chariot at the Battle of Kadesh with two archers , one with the reins tied around the waist to free both hands ( relief from Abu Simbel ) The chariot and horse were introduced to Egypt by the Hyksos invaders in the 16th century BCE and undoubtedly contributed to the military success of the Egyptians . In the remains of Egyptian and Assyrian art , there are numerous representations of chariots , which display rich ornamentation . The chariots of the Egyptians and Assyrians , with whom the bow was the principal arm of attack , were richly mounted with quivers full of arrows . The Egyptians invented the yoke saddle for their chariot horses in c. 1500 BCE . The best preserved examples of Egyptian chariots are the four specimens from the tomb of Tutankhamun . Chariots can be carried by two or more horses . Hittites ( edit ) Hittite chariot ( drawing of an Egyptian relief ) The oldest testimony of chariot warfare in the ancient Near East is the Old Hittite Anitta text ( 18th century BCE ) , which mentions 40 teams of horses ( in the original cuneiform spelling : 40 ṢÍ - IM - TI ANŠE. KUR. RA ) at the siege of Salatiwara . Since the text mentions teams rather than chariots , the existence of chariots in the 18th century BCE is uncertain . The first certain attestation of chariots in the Hittite empire dates to the late 17th century BCE ( Hattusili I ) . A Hittite horse - training text is attributed to Kikkuli the Mitanni ( 15th century BCE ) . The Hittites were renowned charioteers . They developed a new chariot design that had lighter wheels , with four spokes rather than eight , and that held three rather than two warriors . It could hold three warriors because the wheel was placed in the middle of the chariot and not at the back as in Egyptian chariots . Hittite prosperity largely depended on their control of trade routes and natural resources , specifically metals . As the Hittites gained dominion over Mesopotamia , tensions flared among the neighboring Assyrians , Hurrians , and Egyptians . Under Suppiluliuma I , the Hittites conquered Kadesh and , eventually , the whole of Syria . The Battle of Kadesh in 1274 BCE is likely to have been the largest chariot battle ever fought , involving over 5,000 chariots . Persia ( edit ) Main article : Scythed chariot The Persians succeeded Elam in the mid 1st millennium . They may have been the first to yoke four horses to their chariots . They also used scythed chariots . Cyrus the Younger employed these chariots in large numbers at the Battle of Cunaxa . A golden chariot made during Achaemenid Empire ( 550 -- 330 BCE ) . Herodotus mentions that the Libyans and the Indus satrapy supplied cavalry and chariots to Xerxes the Great 's army . However , by this time , cavalry was far more effective and agile than the chariot , and the defeat of Darius III at the Battle of Gaugamela ( 331 BCE ) , where the army of Alexander simply opened their lines and let the chariots pass and attacked them from behind , marked the end of the era of chariot warfare ( barring the Seleucid and Pontic powers , India , China , and the Celtic peoples ) . Ancient China ( edit ) Powerful landlord in chariot ( Eastern Han , 25 -- 220 AD , Anping County , Hebei ) Main article : Chariot ( China ) The earliest archaeological evidence of chariots in China , a chariot burial site discovered in 1933 at Hougang , Anyang in Henan province , dates to the rule of King Wu Ding of the late Shang Dynasty ( c. 1200 BCE ) . Oracle bone inscriptions suggest that the western enemies of the Shang used limited numbers of chariots in battle , but the Shang themselves used them only as mobile command - vehicles and in royal hunts . Bronze Chinese charioteer from the Warring States period ( 403 -- 221 BC ) During the Shang Dynasty , members of the royal family were buried with a complete household and servants , including a chariot , horses , and a charioteer . A Shang chariot was often drawn by two horses , but four - horse variants are occasionally found in burials . Jacques Gernet claims that the Zhou dynasty , which conquered the Shang ca . 1046 BC , made more use of the chariot than did the Shang and `` invented a new kind of harness with four horses abreast '' . The crew consisted of an archer , a driver , and sometimes a third warrior who was armed with a spear or dagger - axe . From the 8th to 5th centuries BCE the Chinese use of chariots reached its peak . Although chariots appeared in greater numbers , infantry often defeated charioteers in battle . Massed - chariot warfare became all but obsolete after the Warring - States Period ( 476 -- 221 BC ) . The main reasons were increased use of the crossbow , use of long halberds up to 18 feet long and pikes up to 22 feet long , and the adoption of standard cavalry units , and the adaptation of mounted archery from nomadic cavalry , which were more effective . Chariots would continue to serve as command posts for officers during the Qin dynasty ( 221 - 206 BC ) and the Han Dynasty ( 206 BCE - 220 AD ) , while armored chariots were also used during the Han Dynasty against the Xiongnu Confederation in the Han -- Xiongnu War ( 133 BC to 89 AD ) , specifically at the Battle of Mobei ( 119 BC ) . Before the Han Dynasty , the power of Chinese states and dynasties was often measured by the number of chariots they were known to have . A country of a thousand chariots ranked as a medium country , and a country of ten thousand chariots ranked as a huge and powerful country . Ancient India ( edit ) Main article : Ratha Horse - drawn chariot carved onto the mandapam of Airavateswarar temple , Darasuram , c. 12th century CE ( left ) . The chariot and its wheel ( right ) are sculpted with fine details Coach driver 2000 B.C.E. Harappa , Indus Valley Civilization Chariots figure prominently in the Rigveda , evidencing their presence in India in the 2nd millennium BCE . Among Rigvedic deities , notably Ushas ( the dawn ) rides in a chariot , as well as Agni in his function as a messenger between gods and men . There are some depictions of chariots among the petroglyphs in the sandstone of the Vindhya range . Two depictions of chariots are found in Morhana Pahar , Mirzapur district . One depicts a biga and the head of the driver . The second depicts a quadriga , with six - spoked wheels , and a driver standing up in a large chariot box . This chariot is being attacked . One figure , who is armed with a shield and a mace , stands in the chariot 's path ; another figure , who is armed with bow and arrow , threatens the right flank . It has been suggested ( speculated ) that the drawings record a story , most probably dating to the early centuries BCE , from some center in the area of the Ganges -- Yamuna plain into the territory of still Neolithic hunting tribes . The very realistic chariots carved into the Sanchi stupas are dated to roughly the 1st century . The scythed chariot was invented by the King of Magadha , Ajatashatru around 475 BCE . He used these chariots against the Licchavis . A scythed war chariot had a sharp , sickle - shaped blade or blades mounted on each end of the axle . The blades , used as weapons , extended horizontally for a metre on the sides of the chariot . There is a chariot displayed at the AP State Archaeology Museum , Hyderabad , Telangana . Gauge ( edit ) A popular legend that has been around since at least 1937 traces the origin of the 4 ft ​ 8 ⁄ in standard railroad gauge to Roman times , suggesting that it was based on the distance between the ruts of rutted roads marked by chariot wheels dating from the Roman Empire . This is encouraged by the fact that the otherwise peculiar distance is almost exactly 5 Roman feet but there is no evidence to span the millennium and a half between the departure of the Romans from Britain and the adoption of the gauge on the Stockton and Darlington railroad in 1825 .

            "Document Text: Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing ( United States ) - wikipedia Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing ( United States ) Jump to : navigation , search For other Thoroughbred Triple Crowns , see Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing . Sir Barton , the first Triple Crown winner , at the 1919 Preakness Stakes American Pharoah , the 12th and latest winner , at the 2015 Preakness Stakes In the United States , the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing , commonly known as the Triple Crown , is a title awarded to a three - year - old Thoroughbred horse who wins the Kentucky Derby , Preakness Stakes , and Belmont Stakes . The three races were inaugurated in different years , the last being the Kentucky Derby in 1875 . These races are now run annually in May and early June of each year . The Triple Crown Trophy , commissioned in 1950 but awarded to all previous winners as well as those after 1950 , is awarded to a Triple Crown winner . The first winner of all three Triple Crown races was Sir Barton in 1919 . Some journalists began using the term Triple Crown to refer to the three races as early as 1923 , but it was not until Gallant Fox won the three events in 1930 that Charles Hatton of the Daily Racing Form put the term into common use . In 99 complete runnings of the Triple Crown including and since Sir Barton 's win , 12 horses have won all three races : Sir Barton ( 1919 ) , Gallant Fox ( 1930 ) , Omaha ( 1935 ) , War Admiral ( 1937 ) , Whirlaway ( 1941 ) , Count Fleet ( 1943 ) , Assault ( 1946 ) , Citation ( 1948 ) , Secretariat ( 1973 ) , Seattle Slew ( 1977 ) , Affirmed ( 1978 ) , and American Pharoah ( 2015 ) . James E. `` Sunny Jim '' Fitzsimmons was the only trainer to win the Triple Crown more than once ; he trained both Gallant Fox and his son Omaha for the Belair Stud breeding farm . Gallant Fox and Omaha are the only father - son duo to win the Triple Crown . Belair Stud and Calumet Farm are tied as the owners with the most Triple Crown victories with two apiece . Calumet Farms won with Whirlaway and Citation . Eddie Arcaro rode both of Calumet Farms ' Triple Crown champions and is the only jockey to win more than one Triple Crown . Secretariat holds the stakes record time for each of the three races . His time of 2 : 24 for ​ 1 ⁄ miles in the 1973 Belmont Stakes also set a world record that still stands . Contents ( hide ) 1 Development 2 Winners 2.1 Records 2.2 Other notable achievements 3 Gaps between wins 4 Unsuccessful bids 5 Sponsorship and broadcasting 6 Individual race winners 7 See also 8 Notes 9 References 10 External links Development ( edit ) The three Triple Crown races had been run for decades before the series received its name ; the Belmont Stakes was first run in 1867 ; the Preakness , in 1873 ; and the Kentucky Derby , in 1875 . The term was in use at least by 1923 , although Daily Racing Form writer Charles Hatton is commonly credited with originating the term in 1930 . Their order has varied . Before 1931 , the Preakness was run before the Kentucky Derby eleven times . On May 12 , 1917 , and May 13 , 1922 , the Kentucky Derby and Preakness were run on the same day . Since 1931 , the Kentucky Derby has been run first , followed by the Preakness , and then the Belmont . Each Triple Crown race is open to both colts and fillies . Though fillies have won each of the individual Triple Crown races , none have won the Triple Crown itself . There have been attempts to develop a `` Filly Triple Crown '' or a `` Triple Tiara '' for fillies only , but no set series of three races consistently remained in the public eye , and at least four different configurations of races were used . Two fillies won the series of the Kentucky Oaks , the Pimlico Oaks ( now the Black - Eyed Susan Stakes ) , and the Coaching Club American Oaks , in 1949 and 1952 , but the racing press did not designate either accomplishment as a `` triple crown . '' In 1961 , the New York Racing Association created a filly triple crown of in - state races only , but the races changed over the years . Eight fillies won the NYRA Triple Tiara between 1968 and 1993 . Gelded colts may run in any of the three races today , but they were prohibited from entering the Belmont between 1919 and 1957 . Geldings have won each of the individual races , but like fillies , no gelding has ever won the Triple Crown . The closest was Funny Cide , who won the Derby and the Preakness in 2003 . All the races are held on dirt tracks , rather than the turf commonly used for important races in Europe . Triple Crown races Race Date Current Track Location Distance Background Cite Trophy Kentucky Derby `` The Run for the Roses '' First Saturday in May Churchill Downs Louisville , Kentucky 1 ⁄ miles ( 2,000 m ) Inaugurated in 1875 , the race was originally 1 ⁄ miles ( 2,400 m ) until 1896 when it was shortened to its current distance . It is the only one of the three races to have been continuously run from its inception . Colts and geldings carry 126 pounds ( 57 kg ) and fillies 121 pounds ( 55 kg ) . The field has been limited to 20 horses since 1975 . The Kentucky Derby Trophy Preakness Stakes `` The Run for the Black - Eyed Susans '' Third Saturday in May Pimlico Race Course Baltimore , Maryland 1 ⁄ miles ( 1,900 m ) Started in 1873 and continuously run since 1894 , it is the shortest of the three races . Pimlico was the home of the race from 1873 to 1889 and again from 1908 until the present . The Preakness was not run from 1891 to 1893 . Weights are the same as for the Derby . Field is limited to 14 horses . The Woodlawn Vase Belmont Stakes `` The Test of the Champion '' Third Saturday following the Preakness ( first or second Saturday in June ) Belmont Park Elmont , New York 1 ⁄ miles ( 2,400 m ) Begun in 1867 , it is the oldest of the three races and the longest , though not held in 1911 and 1912 due to anti-gambling legislation in New York . Race was held at various New York tracks until 1905 when Belmont Park became the permanent location . Distance varied from ​ 1 ⁄ to ​ 1 ⁄ miles until set at ​ 1 ⁄ miles in 1926 . Weight assignments are the same as the other two races . Field is limited to 16 horses .

Castleman 1978 Affirmed Steve Cauthen Laz Barrera Harbor View Farm Harbor View Farm 2015 American Pharoah Victor Espinoza Bob Baffert Ahmed Zayat Ahmed Zayat At completion of the 2016 season , the three Triple Crown races have attracted 4,224 entrants . Of these , 292 horses have won a single leg of the Triple Crown , 52 horses have won two of the races ( 23 the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes , 18 the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes , and 11 the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes ) , and 12 horses have won all three races . Pillory won both the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes in 1922 , a year when it was impossible to win the Triple Crown because the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes were run on the same day . 10 of the 12 winners have been `` homebreds '' , owned at the time of their win by their breeders . Jim Fitzsimmons is the only trainer to have two horses win the Triple Crown , training the sire / son combination of 1930 winner Gallant Fox and 1935 winner Omaha . This also marked the first time that an owner and the first time that a breeder , Belair Stud holding both duties , had a repeat win of the Triple Crown . Calumet Farm is the only other owner with two Triple Crown horses , 1941 winner Whirlaway and 1948 winner Citation . Eddie Arcaro is the only jockey to ride two horses to the Triple Crown , both for Calumet , Whirlaway and Citation . Those two horses ' trainers , Ben Jones and Jimmy Jones , were father and son . All 12 horses , and most owners , trainers , and jockeys were born in the United States . The exceptions were jockey Johnny Longden , born in England and raised in Canada ; French - born jockey Jean Cruguet ; trainer Laz Barrera , from Cuba ; and jockey Victor Espinoza , from Mexico . Secretariat 's trainer , Lucien Laurin and jockey , Ron Turcotte were both Canadians . Owner Fannie Hertz was married to John D. Hertz , who was born in Slovakia ; owner Ahmed Zayat was born in Egypt . Jockey Willie Saunders is considered a Canadian jockey because he grew up and established his career there , but was born in Montana . The horse Sir Barton was foaled in the United States but had a Canadian owner , J.K.L. Ross , at the time of his Triple Crown win . Records ( edit ) Secretariat holds the stakes record for each of the Triple Crown races , the Kentucky Derby ( 1 : 59 2 / 5 ) , the Preakness Stakes ( 1 : 53 ) , and the Belmont Stakes ( 2 : 24 ) . At 18 , Steve Cauthen became the youngest jockey to win the Triple Crown , riding Affirmed in 1978 . At 43 , Victor Espinoza became the oldest jockey to win the Triple Crown , riding American Pharoah in 2015 . Other notable achievements ( edit ) Only one horse , Alydar , has placed ( finished second ) in all three races . He was defeated by Affirmed in all three races in 1978 by a combined margin of two lengths . His trainer John Vietch is the only trainer to have done this with one horse . In 1995 , D. Wayne Lukas became the first and only major figure ( owner , jockey , or trainer ) to win all three Triple Crown races with different horses , Thunder Gulch in the Derby and Belmont , Timber Country in the Preakness . Lukas also is the only trainer to have won six straight Triple Crown races , adding his 1995 wins , having won the 1994 Preakness and Belmont with Tabasco Cat and the 1996 Derby with Grindstone . Like Vietch , only with two different horses , Bob Baffert also had second - place finishes in all three legs of the Triple Crown , both owned by Ahmed Zayat : in 2012 , Bodemeister finished second in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness stakes to I 'll Have Another , then Paynter was entered and finished second to Union Rags . Baffert and Zayat teamed up again for the 2015 Triple Crown victory of American Pharoah . Gallant Fox is the only Triple Crown winner to sire another U.S. Triple Crown winner , Omaha . Affirmed sired Peteski , winner of the 1993 Canadian Triple Crown . Whirlaway , in addition to winning the 1941 Triple Crown , also won the Travers Stakes that year , becoming the first and only horse to date to accomplish that feat . American Pharoah , in addition to winning the 2015 Triple Crown , also won the Breeders ' Cup Classic that year . As the Breeders ' Cup was not established until 1984 , American Pharoah was the first to sweep all four races , a feat that came to be known as the Grand Slam . Gaps between wins ( edit ) California Chrome ( second from right ) was stepped on by the number 3 horse while leaving the starting gate at the 2014 Belmont Stakes After the first Triple Crown winner , Sir Barton , in 1919 , there was not another winner until Gallant Fox in 1930 , a gap of 11 years . Between 1930 and 1948 , seven horses won the Triple Crown , with five years being the longest gap between winners . However , following the 1948 win of Citation , there was a considerable gap of 25 years before Secretariat ended the drought of Triple Crown champions in 1973 . Between 1973 and 1978 , there were three Triple Crown winners . After Affirmed 's Triple Crown in 1978 , the longest drought in Triple Crown history began in 1979 with Spectacular Bid 's failed Triple Crown attempt at the Belmont Stakes , and lasted until American Pharoah won in 2015 . Between 1979 and 2014 thirteen horses won both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes , but either failed to win the Belmont Stakes or could not start in the race . Of those , Real Quiet came the closest to winning the Triple Crown , losing the Belmont Stakes by a nose in 1998 . Spectacular Bid finished 3rd in 1979 . Pleasant Colony finished 3rd in 1981 . Alysheba finished 4th in 1987 . Sunday Silence finished 2nd in 1989 . Real Quiet finished 2nd in 1998 . Charismatic finished 3rd in 1999 . War Emblem finished 8th in 2002 . Funny Cide finished 3rd in 2003 . Smarty Jones finished 2nd in 2004 . Big Brown did not finish in 2008 . I 'll Have Another did not start ( injury ) 2012 . California Chrome finished 4th in 2014 . In the 1979 - 2015 period , horses who contested all three races , losing the Kentucky Derby but winning the Preakness and the Belmont were Risen Star in 1988 , Hansel in 1991 , Tabasco Cat in 1994 , Point Given in 2001 , and Afleet Alex in 2005 . In 1984 , Swale and in 1995 , Thunder Gulch ran all three races , winning the Derby and the Belmont , but not the Preakness . The 37 - year gap between the Triple Crown wins of Affirmed and American Pharoah drew criticism of the system . As far back as 1986 , reporters noted that horses who were fresh for the Belmont had an advantage . In 2003 , Gary Stevens stated in an interview with Charlie Rose that he did not believe there would be another Triple Crown winner because of the tendency for owners to put fresh horses in the Preakness and Belmont Stakes . California Chrome co-owner Steve Coburn was particularly critical of the Triple Crown system in post-Belmont remarks in 2014 ; he considered the system to be unfair , arguing that there would never be another Triple Crown winner in his lifetime unless only horses that competed in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness competed at the Belmont . By 2014 , six of the previous eight Belmont winners had not competed in either of the first two legs of the Triple Crown . Additionally , from 2006 to 2014 , the Belmont winner was a horse who had not competed in the Preakness . American Pharoah was the first Belmont winner since Afleet Alex in 2005 to have run all three Triple Crown races . Unsuccessful bids ( edit ) Big Brown , the winner of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes , at the 2008 Belmont Stakes , where he was pulled up and did not finish . Since all three races were inaugurated , as of 2017 , 23 horses have won the Derby and Preakness but not the Belmont : 1932 : Burgoo King did not enter the Belmont due to lameness . 1936 : Bold Venture did not enter the Belmont due to lameness . 1944 : Pensive was the first horse to contest but lose the Belmont after winning the first two legs . He placed second to Bounding Home , who had not run in the Derby or the Preakness . 1958 : Tim Tam , defeated by six lengths by Cavan , who had not contested the Derby or Preakness . 1961 : Carry Back , `` sore '' after the race , was seventh of nine entries , ​ 14 ⁄ lengths behind the winner , a longshot named Sherluck . 1964 : Northern Dancer , defeated by Quadrangle . 1966 : Kauai King , defeated by Amberoid . 1968 : Forward Pass , defeated by Stage Door Johnny by ​ 1 ⁄ lengths . 1969 : Majestic Prince , second by ​ 5 ⁄ lengths to Arts and Letters . Loss attributed to fatigue and lameness . 1971 : Cañonero II , fourth in the Belmont to 34 -- 1 longshot Pass Catcher , the loss attributed to a hoof problem . 1979 : Spectacular Bid , third in Belmont , was alleged to have stepped on a safety pin the morning of the race , though another theory blamed rider error by an inexperienced young jockey moving him too soon . He finished ​ 3 ⁄ lengths behind Coastal and a neck behind the second - place horse , Golden Act . 1981 : Pleasant Colony , third in Belmont , ​ 1 ⁄ lengths behind Summing and the second - place horse , Highland Blade . 1987 : Alysheba finished fourth in Belmont behind Bet Twice , Cryptoclearance , and Gulch . 1989 : Sunday Silence , second in Belmont , eight lengths behind Easy Goer . 1997 : Silver Charm , second in Belmont , ​ ⁄ length behind Touch Gold . 1998 : Real Quiet , second in Belmont after a photo finish , a nose behind Victory Gallop . 1999 : Charismatic , third in Belmont , ​ 1 ⁄ lengths behind Lemon Drop Kid and second - place Vision and Verse . Charismatic was pulled up soon after the finish , vanned off with a bone fracture . He survived and was retired to stud . 2002 : War Emblem stumbled at gate in Belmont , finished eighth out of 11 . Winner Sarava scored upset at record odds of 70 - 1 . 2003 : Funny Cide , third in Belmont , five lengths behind Empire Maker , and ​ 4 ⁄ lengths behind second - place horse , Ten Most Wanted . 2004 : Smarty Jones , second in Belmont , one length behind Birdstone . 2008 : Big Brown was pulled up in the home stretch of the Belmont , eased to a last - place finish . Winner was Da ' Tara . A hoof problem had limited Big Brown 's training , and may have been a factor in his defeat . 2012 : I 'll Have Another was scratched from the Belmont the day before the race due to a tendon injury . 2014 : California Chrome finished in a dead heat for 4th in the Belmont after being stepped on by another horse leaving the gate and running the race with an injury to his heel and a scrape on his tendon . Sponsorship and broadcasting ( edit ) See also : Sports broadcasting contracts in the United States Originally , the three races largely organized their own nominations procedure , marketing and television broadcast rights . In 1985 , Triple Crown Productions was created when the owner of Spend a Buck chose not to run in the other two Triple Crown races because of a financial incentive offered to any Kentucky Derby winner who could win a set of competing races in New Jersey . The organizers of the three races realized that they needed to work together . Efforts to unify the sponsorship and marketing of all three Triple Crown races began in 1987 when ABC Sports negotiated a deal with Chrysler to pay $5 million to any horse that swept all three races , and $1 million each year there was no Triple Crown sweep to the horse with the highest combined Triple Crown finish . This sponsorship lasted until 1993 . The end of the $1 million participation bonus was linked to the breakdown of Prairie Bayou at the Belmont Stakes that year and the uncomfortable situation that arose when the Kentucky Derby winner , Sea Hero , was given the bonus following a seventh - place finish . In 1995 , Visa USA took over the sponsorship with a 10 - year contract , naming the series the Visa Triple Crown and offering only the $5 million bonus to a horse that could sweep the Triple Crown . Along with sponsorship by VISA , NBC Sports paid $51.5 million for broadcast rights to all three races , with the revenue split giving 50 % of the total to Churchill Downs and 25 % each to Pimlico and to the New York Racing Association ( NYRA ) . The Visa deal -- and the cooperative effort -- ended after 2005 . The NYRA felt that they did not get a fair share of the revenue , particularly when the Belmont had the highest ratings of all three races in the years where a Triple Crown was on the line . From 2001 through 2013 , average viewership for the Belmont was 7 million when the Triple Crown was not at stake , whereas viewership averaged 13 million when it was . With the contract term ending , the NYRA went to ESPN on ABC for the 2006 Belmont , while the broadcasts of the Derby and Preakness remained with NBC . Visa chose to remain as a sponsor of only Kentucky Derby for the next five years . As a result of the divided broadcast , Triple Crown Productions was unable to obtain a new sponsor . Years Sponsor Bonuses 1987 -- 1993 Chrysler Corporation $1 million ( best overall record ) $5 million ( three wins ) 1995 -- 2005 Visa USA $5 million ( three wins ) 2006 -- present Triple Crown Productions None In February 2011 , ABC / ESPN dropped out of the negotiations to renew broadcast rights to the Belmont Stakes . NBC obtained the contract through 2015 , once again uniting all three races on the same network . In 2014 , NBC extended their contract for the Kentucky Derby through 2025 . As of August 2015 , NBC obtained a broadcast contract for the Belmont through 2020 and the Preakness through 2022 .

            "Document Text: Cart before the horse - wikipedia Cart before the horse The expression cart before the horse is an idiom or proverb used to suggest something is done contrary to a conventional or culturally expected order or relationship . A cart is a vehicle which is ordinarily pulled by a horse , so to put the cart before the horse is an analogy for doing things in the wrong order . The figure of speech means doing things the wrong way round or with the wrong emphasis . The idiom is about confusing cause and effect . The meaning of the phrase is based on the common knowledge that a horse usually pulls a cart , despite rare examples of vehicles pushed by horses in 19th - century Germany and early 20th - century France . Contents 1 History 2 Context 3 See also 4 References History ( edit ) The earliest recorded use of the proverb was in the early 16th century . It was a figure of speech in the Renaissance . Context ( edit ) The idiom is used in a context which reverses the usual chronological order of A and B .

            "Document Text: Third - level education in the Republic of Ireland - Wikipedia Third - level education in the Republic of Ireland Jump to : navigation , search Third - level education in the Republic of Ireland includes all education after second - level , encompassing higher education in universities and colleges and further education on Post Leaving Certificate ( PLC ) and other courses . The degree - awarding authorities approved by the Government of Ireland , which can grant awards at all academic levels , are University of Dublin , National University of Ireland ( Cork , Dublin , Galway and Maynooth ) , Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland , Dublin City University , Dublin Institute of Technology , Higher Education and Training Awards Council , St. Patrick 's College , Maynooth ( Pontifical University ) , and University of Limerick . The King 's Inns of Dublin has a limited role in education specialising in the preparation of candidates for the degree of barrister - at - law to practice as barristers . Medical schools in Ireland also have particular regulation . There were seven establishments of higher education within the Republic of Ireland ranked among the top 500 universities worldwide by the Times Higher Education Supplement in 2008 . Contents ( hide ) 1 Framework 1.1 Institutions 1.2 Fees 2 Further education 3 List of higher education establishments 3.1 Universities 3.2 Institutes of technology 3.3 National institutions 3.4 Colleges of education 3.5 Recognised , associated or constituent colleges of Irish universities 3.6 Independent education 4 Foreign Institutions with a presence in Ireland 5 Defunct institutions 6 Footnotes 7 See also 8 References 9 External links Framework ( edit ) EFQ level EHEA cycle NFQ level Major award types Level 1 Certificate Level 2 Certificate Level 3 Certificate Junior Certificate Level 4 Certificate Leaving Certificate 5 Level 5 Certificate Leaving Certificate 5 6 Advanced Certificate Short cycle within 1st Higher Certificate 6 1st 7 Ordinary Bachelor 's degree 8 Honours bachelor 's degree Higher diploma 7 2nd 9 Master 's degree Postgraduate diploma 8 3rd 10 Doctorate degree Higher doctorate Institutions ( edit ) Some colleges are `` constituent '' or `` linked '' colleges of universities , while others are designated institutions of the Higher Education and Training Awards Council . The latter include the Institutes of Technology , Colleges of Education , and other independent colleges . Some colleges have `` delegated authority '' from the Higher Education and Training Awards Council , this allows them to confer and validate awards in their own name . Some institutions such as the University of Limerick , Dublin Institute of Technology and Dublin City University ( DCU ) have completed a process of modularising their courses ( others are still in a transition phase ) , mostly using the ECTS . The Bologna process and applied research are the current concerns of national educational policy , additional concerns include the structures of the National University of Ireland and Trinity College , Dublin . Since the mid-2000s , a number of Institutes of Technology have applied for university designation , including Dublin Institute of Technology , Cork and Waterford . The Marks & Standards document , offered by most institutions , can be consulted for information on the range and criteria set down for awards , while programme specifications offer additional information . In contrast to practice in the rest of the education system , entry tends to be highly competitive for school leavers ; the so - called `` Points Race '' . In 2001 the percentage of school leavers transferring to third level exceeded 50 % for the first time , as of 2005 it is in excess of 55 % and expected to grow at approximately 1 % per annum for the next decade . There are over 25 third - level courses at graduate and postgraduate level offered through the Irish language . Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge is the Irish language Department of the National University of Ireland , Galway ( NUI Galway ) and it has different off - campus centres throughout the Gaeltacht regions . Dublin City University has an Irish language department called Fiontar , University College Dublin ( UCD ) , Dublin Institute of Technology and Galway - Mayo Institute of Technology ( GMIT ) also offer similar courses . All but two of the seven universities in the Republic of Ireland offer `` open '' ( omnibus entry ) Bachelor of Arts degrees through the CAO where the student can choose their specialisation after their first year of study . The two universities that do not offer `` open '' ( omnibus entry ) arts degrees , ( Trinity College , Dublin and Dublin City University ) do still offer Bachelor of Arts degrees in specific areas of study such as Drama Studies , Journalism , Latin , History , Japanese and International Relations . In one , Trinity College , Dublin , the applicants wishing to read an Arts degree may apply to the college to read a combination of two subjects , such as French and Philosophy - which the student may continue to read jointly or with focus on one . Dublin City University 's de facto omnibus entry arts degree is offered by St. Patrick 's College of Education ( a college of DCU ) and is titled `` BA in Humanities '' , All Hallows College ( a college of DCU ) offer BA in Humanities , Theology Pastoral Care , and English . Entry into Higher education institutions is normally done through the CAO or Central Applications Office . In this way , students wishing to enter university apply to the CAO rather than the individual university . Places in courses are usually awarded based on results in the Leaving Certificate Examination or any international equivalent . Each university has a minimum entry requirement , usually requiring a pass grade in either English or Irish , as well as maths . Some also require a pass grade in a modern continental European language ( French , German , Spanish or Italian ) . Each individual course has further entry requirements , for example , science courses usually require a certain grade in one or two sciences . The student must also achieve the number of points required for the course under the points system . However , universities also have systems in place for accepting mature students , and students who have successfully completed a Post Leaving Certificate or Further Education course . Entry into third - level is generally very high in the Republic of Ireland ( as it also is in Northern Ireland ) , and among young adults ( those aged 25 to 34 ) , 41.6 % of them have attained third - level degrees -- the second highest level in the EU after Cyprus , and substantially ahead of the average of 29.1 % . Fees ( edit ) Under the `` Free Fees Initiative '' the Exchequer will pay the tuition fees of students who meet relevant course , nationality and residence requirements as set down under the initiative . These requirements include : Holding EU nationality , or are a national of member country of the European Economic Area or Switzerland , or those who have been granted official refugee status . Having been a resident in an EU Member State for at least three of the five years preceding entry to the course . Are not undertaking a second undergraduate course . Students are required to pay a `` registration fee '' on entry to their courses . These charges cover costs such as equipment usage , administration fees and exam fees . Charges for 2008 / 09 were on average € 850 per student , but was raised to € 1,500 per student for the 2009 / 10 school year . These charges have been labelled as `` unofficial fees '' , and University Heads have admitted that `` student registration charges are fees by any other name '' . In 2011 , after large annual increases , the Registration Fee was abolished and replaced with a Student Contribution . For the school year 2015 / 2016 this fee stands at € 3,000 . This is a list of colleges and universities within the Republic of Ireland ; some colleges are constituent colleges of universities . Further education ( edit ) See also : List of further education colleges in the Republic of Ireland Further education is vocational and technical education and training in post-compulsory education . Awards are offered by a multitude of bodies , both ad - hoc and statutory . Typical areas included apprenticeships , childcare , farming , retail , and tourism . These are typical areas of the economy that do not depend on multinational investment and recognition . There are many different types of further education awards , known as Post Leaving Certificates . The Further Education and Training Awards Council conferred awards in the extra-university system . Further education has expanded immensely in recent years helped by the institutions , and because of this the type and range of these awards have been formalized to restore confidence . There are two separate schemes enabling progression for holders of FETAC awards to Universities and Institutes of Technology . FETAC awards carried points that can be used to access higher education . FETAC was dissolved and its functions were passed to Quality and Qualifications Ireland ( QQI ) on November 6 , 2012 .

            "Document Text: Third - level education in the Republic of Ireland - Wikipedia Third - level education in the Republic of Ireland Third - level education in the Republic of Ireland includes all education after second - level , encompassing higher education in universities and colleges and further education on Post Leaving Certificate ( PLC ) and other courses . The degree - awarding authorities approved by the Government of Ireland , which can grant awards at all academic levels , are University of Dublin , National University of Ireland ( Cork , Dublin , Galway and Maynooth ) , Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland , Dublin City University , Dublin Institute of Technology , Higher Education and Training Awards Council , St. Patrick 's College , Maynooth ( Pontifical University ) , and University of Limerick . The King 's Inns of Dublin has a limited role in education specialising in the preparation of candidates for the degree of barrister - at - law to practice as barristers . Medical schools in Ireland also have particular regulation . There were seven establishments of higher education within the Republic of Ireland ranked among the top 500 universities worldwide by the Times Higher Education Supplement in 2008 . Contents 1 Framework 1.1 Institutions 1.2 Fees 2 Further education 3 List of higher education establishments 3.1 Universities 3.2 Institutes of technology 3.3 National institutions 3.4 Colleges of education 3.5 Recognised , associated or constituent colleges of Irish universities 3.6 Independent education 4 Foreign institutions with a presence in Ireland 5 Defunct institutions 6 Footnotes 7 See also 8 References 9 External links Framework ( edit ) EQF level EHEA cycle NFQ level Major award types Level 1 Certificate Level 2 Certificate Level 3 Certificate Junior Certificate Level 4 Certificate Leaving Certificate 5 Level 5 Certificate Leaving Certificate 5 6 Advanced Certificate Short cycle within 1st Higher Certificate 6 1st 7 Ordinary Bachelor 's degree 8 Honours bachelor 's degree Higher diploma 7 2nd 9 Master 's degree Postgraduate diploma 8 3rd 10 Doctorate degree Higher doctorate Institutions ( edit ) Some colleges are `` constituent '' or `` linked '' colleges of universities , while others are designated institutions of the Higher Education and Training Awards Council . The latter include the Institutes of Technology , Colleges of Education , and other independent colleges . Some colleges have `` delegated authority '' from the Higher Education and Training Awards Council , this allows them to confer and validate awards in their own name . Some institutions such as the University of Limerick , Dublin Institute of Technology and Dublin City University ( DCU ) have completed a process of modularising their courses ( others are still in a transition phase ) , mostly using the ECTS . The Bologna process and applied research are the current concerns of national educational policy , additional concerns include the structures of the National University of Ireland and Trinity College , Dublin . Since the mid-2000s , a number of Institutes of Technology have applied for university designation , including Dublin Institute of Technology , Cork and Waterford . The Marks & Standards document , offered by most institutions , can be consulted for information on the range and criteria set down for awards , while programme specifications offer additional information . In contrast to practice in the rest of the education system , entry tends to be highly competitive for school leavers ; the so - called `` Points Race '' . In 2001 the percentage of school leavers transferring to third level exceeded 50 % for the first time , as of 2005 it is in excess of 55 % and expected to grow at approximately 1 % per annum for the next decade . There are over 25 third - level courses at graduate and postgraduate level offered through the Irish language . Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge is the Irish language Department of the National University of Ireland , Galway ( NUI Galway ) and it has different off - campus centres throughout the Gaeltacht regions . Dublin City University has an Irish language department called Fiontar , University College Dublin ( UCD ) , Dublin Institute of Technology and Galway - Mayo Institute of Technology ( GMIT ) also offer similar courses . All but two of the seven universities in the Republic of Ireland offer `` open '' ( omnibus entry ) Bachelor of Arts degrees through the CAO where the student can choose their specialisation after their first year of study . The two universities that do not offer `` open '' ( omnibus entry ) arts degrees , ( Trinity College , Dublin and Dublin City University ) do still offer Bachelor of Arts degrees in specific areas of study such as Drama Studies , Journalism , Latin , History , Japanese and International Relations . In one , Trinity College , Dublin , the applicants wishing to read an Arts degree may apply to the college to read a combination of two subjects , such as French and Philosophy - which the student may continue to read jointly or with focus on one . Dublin City University 's de facto omnibus entry arts degree is offered by St. Patrick 's College of Education ( a college of DCU ) and is titled `` BA in Humanities '' , All Hallows College ( a college of DCU ) offer BA in Humanities , Theology Pastoral Care , and English . Entry into Higher education institutions is normally done through the CAO or Central Applications Office . In this way , students wishing to enter university apply to the CAO rather than the individual university . Places in courses are usually awarded based on results in the Leaving Certificate Examination or any international equivalent . Each university has a minimum entry requirement , usually requiring a pass grade in either English or Irish , as well as maths . Some also require a pass grade in a modern continental European language ( French , German , Spanish or Italian ) . Each individual course has further entry requirements , for example , science courses usually require a certain grade in one or two sciences . The student must also achieve the number of points required for the course under the points system . However , universities also have systems in place for accepting mature students , and students who have successfully completed a Post Leaving Certificate or Further Education course . Entry into third - level is generally very high in the Republic of Ireland ( as it also is in Northern Ireland ) , and among young adults ( those aged 25 to 34 ) , 41.6 % of them have attained third - level degrees -- the second highest level in the EU after Cyprus , and substantially ahead of the average of 29.1 % . Broken down by gender , approximately 43 % of women and 40 % of men Ireland attend third level education . Fees ( edit ) Under the `` Free Fees Initiative '' the Exchequer will pay the tuition fees of students who meet relevant course , nationality and residence requirements as set down under the initiative . These requirements include : Holding EU nationality , or are a national of member country of the European Economic Area or Switzerland , or those who have been granted official refugee status . Having been a resident in an EU Member State for at least three of the five years preceding entry to the course . Are not undertaking a second undergraduate course . Students are required to pay a `` registration fee '' on entry to their courses . These charges cover costs such as equipment usage , administration fees and exam fees . Charges for 2008 / 09 were on average € 850 per student , but was raised to € 1,500 per student for the 2009 / 10 school year . These charges have been labelled as `` unofficial fees '' , and University Heads have admitted that `` student registration charges are fees by any other name '' . In 2011 , after large annual increases , the Registration Fee was abolished and replaced with a Student Contribution . For the school year 2015 / 2016 this fee stands at € 3,000 . Further education ( edit ) See also : List of further education colleges in the Republic of Ireland Further education is vocational and technical education and training in post-compulsory education . Awards are offered by a multitude of bodies , both ad - hoc and statutory . Typical areas included apprenticeships , childcare , farming , retail , and tourism . These are typical areas of the economy that do not depend on multinational investment and recognition . There are many different types of further education awards , known as Post Leaving Certificates . The Further Education and Training Awards Council conferred awards in the extra-university system . Further education has expanded immensely in recent years helped by the institutions , and because of this the type and range of these awards have been formalized to restore confidence . There are two separate schemes enabling progression for holders of FETAC awards to Universities and Institutes of Technology . FETAC awards carried points that can be used to access higher education . FETAC was dissolved and its functions were passed to Quality and Qualifications Ireland ( QQI ) on November 6 , 2012 .

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( November 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Eleventh grade , junior year , or grade 11 ( called Year 12 in the UK ) is the eleventh , and for some countries final , grade of secondary schools . Students are typically 16 -- 17 years of age , depending on the country and the students ' birthdays . Contents 1 Australia 2 Bangladesh 3 Belgium 4 Bulgaria 5 Canada 6 Colombia 7 Finland 8 France 9 Hong Kong 10 India 11 Ireland 12 Italy 13 Malaysia 14 Mexico 15 Norway 16 New Zealand 17 Pakistan 18 Philippines 19 Russia 20 Singapore 21 Spain 22 Sweden 23 United Kingdom 23.1 England and Wales 23.2 Scotland 23.3 Northern Ireland 24 United States 25 See also 26 References Australia ( edit ) In Australia , Year Eleven is typically the twelfth year of education and fifth ( except South Australia , which it is the fourth ) year of high school education . Although there are slight variations between the states , most students in Year Eleven are aged around fifteen , sixteen or seventeen . Queensland year - eleven students are the youngest in the country , as they usually enter at age fifteen . In New South Wales , Year Eleven is the shortest year as it only lasts three whole terms . Year Twelve begins its first term where Year Eleven would have its fourth . Year Eleven is followed by Year Twelve , the final year of high school . Bangladesh ( edit ) Grade eleven is the first year of college in Bangladesh . Students in this grade are sixteen to seventeen years old and get the chance to study in this grade after passing the Secondary School Certificate ( SSC ) or equivalent exam . In Bangladesh this grade is also referred as ' Class 11 ' or ' Inter first year ' or ' Intermediate first year ' or ' HSC first year ' etc . Belgium ( edit ) In Belgium , the 11th grade is called `` 5ème secondaire '' in the French speaking part of the country , and `` 5de middelbaar '' in the Dutch speaking part . Bulgaria ( edit ) In Bulgaria , the 11th grade it 's the penultimate year of the high - school ( gymnasium ) stage . Students tend to be 17 - 18 years old . Canada ( edit ) In all provinces and territories , except Quebec , a student continues to Grade 12 to complete their high school , or secondary , education . In Quebec , Grade 11 ( sec. 5 ) is the final year of secondary education , followed by college , a pre-university level unique to Quebec . Colombia ( edit ) The eleventh grade is the last year in secondary education . In this year , all students are required to do an internship in any subject field . To differentiate from Universities ' internships , the practice is called ' alphabetisation ' ; most of the time is related to community services , such as teaching in schools , or assisting in hospitals or libraries . Students also do the ICFES National Test and they present to the draft for the Colombian Army . By law , the army can not recruit under - age students ; most of eleventh - graders are aged 16 - 17 , and the draft is almost changed for the payment of a monetary fee . This year is called the senior year . Finland ( edit ) In Finland there are three years of high school , which starts in 11th grade at the age of 16 . 10th grade is usually skipped . France ( edit ) The equivalent is the Première , which is the penultimate year of Secondary education in France ( followed by the Terminale ) . Hong Kong ( edit ) In Hong Kong , 11th grade is called Form 5 . India ( edit ) In India , after appearing for the boards , the percentages determine the streams in which the student can study . There are three streams : Science , which comprises Physics , Chemistry , Biology , English , Computer Science / Informatics / Physical Education / Maths / Psychology / Home Science , Commerce , which comprises Accountancy , Marketing , English , Business Studies , Business Economics , Informatics / Maths / Physical Education , Humanities / Arts which comprises English , Psychology , Fashion Studies / Home science , Informatics . The combination of streams can vary from Institutions . But in abroad places , the streams are determined by the model exam , which is under the school . The stream which the students opt for are the basis of which degree they can study . Generally eleventh grade is known as + 1 which originates from the term 10 + 1 . This year is generally the continuation of grade 9 and grade 12 is the continuation of grade 10 . Ireland ( edit ) It is Fifth Year or Cúigú Bhliain of Secondary School ( for 15 - to 17 - year - olds as there is an optional year beforehand ) . In this year , students prepare for the Leaving Certificate . Italy ( edit ) In Italy , eleventh grade is called * Terza superiore * ( 3rd class of the Superior / High School , two left ) . Malaysia ( edit ) In Malaysia , 11th grade also known as Form 5 in secondary school . The students at this stage are 17 years old , and it is the fifth and last year in the secondary school . ( Compare to Form 6 or known as 12th grade ) Mexico ( edit ) In some parts the eleventh grade is the second year of high school . Most students enter this grade as 16 year olds , but some might enter early as 15 and late as 17 . Norway ( edit ) In Norway , the eleventh year of education is the first year of Videregående skole , equivalent to high school . It is very rarely referred to as the eleventh grade , but rather the first grade of Videregående or VG1 . Although Videregående skole is not compulsory for Norwegians , approximately 93 % of people aged 16 - 18 enroll . There is no upper age limit for starting or finishing Videregående skole , but students can not enroll earlier than the year they turn 16 . New Zealand ( edit ) In New Zealand , Year 12 is the equivalent of eleventh grade , with students aged 16 or 17 during the years . It is the fourth year of secondary school and the twelfth year of compulsory education . During Year 12 , most students complete Level 2 of the National Certificate of Educational Achievement ( NCEA ) , the country 's main national qualification for secondary school students . Students in Year 12 typically study English ( or Te Reo Māori ) and a minimum of five elective subjects with mathematics highly recommended . Pakistan ( edit ) Grade eleven is the first of two years in college ( grade twelve being the last and final year before postgraduate and university education ) and is equivalently referred to as `` first year . '' Students in this year level are fifteen to sixteen years old . Students get to select from the following subjects : Pre-medical ( Biology , Physics , Chemistry ) Pre-engineering ( Math , Physics , Chemistry ) Commerce Humanities Science Home economics Arts And the compulsory subjects are Urdu , Islamic studies ( 1st year only ) and Pakistan studies ( 2nd year only ) . The students can select the preferred subject on the basis of SSC result ( 9th and 10th grade ) Philippines ( edit ) In the Philippines , Grade 11 is the first year of Senior High School . Topics discussed depend on the four tracks and their strands . Academic Track ABM ( Accountancy , Business & Management ) STEM ( Science , Technology , Engineering & Mathematics ) HUMSS ( Humanities & Social Sciences ) GAS ( General Academic Strand ) Pre-Baccalaureate Maritime Technical - Vocational Track Agro-Fishery Arts Home Economics Industrial Arts Information Communications Technology ( ICT ) Sports Track Arts and Design Track Since school year 2016 - 2017 . Students are usually 16 -- 17 years old . Russia ( edit ) The eleventh grade is final year of secondary education , the end of the high school , and it is an examinational year , when training to USE is being more powerful , than in tenth grade . Priority of education in this year is given to repeat the material learned in high school ( Fifth to Tenth years ) in Mathematics , Russian language and in exam subjects by pupils ' choice . Singapore ( edit ) In Singapore , 11th grade is equivalent of Secondary 5 level . Only people taking N Levels ( normal academic levels ) will go to secondary 5 , those in express streams will take their O levels ( ordinary levels ) in secondary 4 , and then continue to a Junior College for 2 years or Polytechnic for 3 years . Spain ( edit ) The closest equivalent to the eleventh grade is the first year of Bachillerato . It is for pupils aged 16 to 17 . It is a year of many changes when pupils can start to choose what they would like to study in the future at university . Sweden ( edit ) This is the second year of Upper Secondary School . United kingdom ( edit ) England and Wales ( edit ) Main article : Sixth form Year 12 , or Lower Sixth form , is comparable to the 11th grade in the US . It is the sixth and penultimate year of secondary education . For students who entered secondary school before September 2008 , it is not compulsory to attend these last two years . During Year 12 , three Advanced Subsidiary units are completed per subject ( either written exams , coursework or a mixture , depending on subject ) . Often students choose four AS - Level subjects in Year 12 ( some students may decide to take three or five ) . Students then enter Year 13 ( equivalent to 12th grade ) and may choose to drop a subject , going on to complete three subjects . Successful completion generally results in the award of A-Level qualifications , though BTECs can be received . Scotland ( edit ) In Scotland , fifth year ( of secondary education ) or S5 is optional , where pupils will generally sit Higher qualifications which form the core entry requirements for university . It is followed by an optional final sixth year ( also known as S6 ) . The students ages normally range from 16 - 17 in this year . Northern ireland ( edit ) The system is similar to the English one at this age . Lower Sixth Form ( Year 13 ) , pupils start on a two - year course , at the end of which they will hopefully have gained three ' A ' Levels in their chosen subjects . United States ( edit ) This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( October 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) In the US , a student in the eleventh grade is typically referred to as a third year high school student or junior . Junior year is typically the third year class in high school . Many students take the SAT Reasoning Test and / or ACT in the second half of their third year of high school . Math students usually take Algebra II , but classes like Trigonometry or Pre-Calculus are sometimes offered for students who wish to take Advanced Placement math classes in their fourth year of high school . Depending on the location there may be a combination of any of the listed subjects . They may also take easier courses such as Algebra I and Geometry if they do not have the required prerequisites for the more advanced courses that are listed above . Students who are advanced in mathematics often take Calculus or Statistics . In science classes , third year students are taught usually Biology , or Chemistry especially Lab Chemistry . Atoms , molecules , and Stoichiometry is taught as well . In English class , a college - preparatory curriculum would also include American literature . Often , English literature ( also referred to as British literature ) is taught in the third year of high school . Books and authors learned include The Glass Menagerie , The Scarlet Letter , The Crucible , The Great Gatsby , Of Mice and Men , The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , The Grapes of Wrath , Jonathan Edwards , Amy Tan , and Lorraine Hansberry . In a social studies curriculum , third year students in the United States are usually taught US history or the world from the 1870s to the 21st Century . They may also acquire more advanced world culture and geography knowledge , along with some more - advanced social studies such as psychology and government . Many high school third year students in the United States opt to take a foreign language , even though it is not required in many secondary schools curricula . While normally followed by twelfth grade , some colleges will accept excelling students out of this grade as part of an early college entrance program . Alternatively , some students may choose to graduate early through standardized testing or advanced credits .

The CMS missionaries interacted with locals in the coastal town of Mombasa and set up one of the earliest mission schools in the country at Rabai in 1846 . With the expansion of the railway from Mombasa to Uganda , the missionaries expanded their work into Kenya 's interior . An attempt to set up a school and mission at Yatta in 1894 was resisted by the Kamba tribe . The missionaries then penetrated into western Kenya and set up schools and missions . The first school in western Kenya was established at Kaimosi in 1902 . During the colonial era , the number of Kenyans with exposure to education steadily increased and a good number of them were privileged to proceed abroad for further education . Among those who furthered their education abroad in the colonial era were Jomo Kenyatta , who attended Woodbrooke College and London School of Economics , Charles Njonjo , who attended Grays Inn Law School , Peter Mbiyu Koinange , who attended Columbia University , Mwai Kibaki who attended London School of Economics , R. Mugo Gatheru who attended Roosevelt University , Tom Mboya , who attended Ruskin College , Oxford , Masinde Muliro , who attended University of Cape Town , Julius Gikonyo Kiano who attended Stanford University , Paul Ngei and Barack Obama Sr. , who attended the University of Hawaii at Manoa . Julius Gikonyo Kiano was the first Kenyan to obtain a PhD . He returned to Kenya and was instrumental in establishing a school in Githunguri . The trend steadily rose over the years and by the time of independence in 1963 , 840,000 African children were attending elementary school . The earliest schools in Kenya ( edit ) Nairobi European School . School at Rabai near Mombasa -- established 1846 Nairobi School established 1902 . Friends School Kaimosi , now Kaimosi Friends Primary School , established in 1903 Maseno School , established in 1906 Government Indian School or The Duke of Gloucester School , now Jamhuri High School , established 1906 Tumutumu Mission School , now Tumutumu Girls ' High School established in 1908 .

Kapsabet High School , established 1925 . Alliance School , now Alliance High School ( Kenya ) established in 1926 . St. Mary 's School Yala , established in 1927 . Highlands High School , now Moi Girls ' High School -- Eldoret established in 1928 . Kitale Primary , later Kitale Academy , now Kitale School established 1929 Kisii School , established in 1932 Pre and post colonial education systems ( edit ) A classroom in Athi River , Kenya . Kenya began a campaign for free primary education after independence in 1963 . Since then , the system of education has undergone transformation twice . Before independence elementary education was based on the colonial system of education . East African community ( 7 -- 4 -- 2 -- 3 system ) ( edit ) In 1967 , Kenya , with Uganda and Tanzania , formed the East African Community . The three countries adopted a single system of education , the 7 -- 4 -- 2 -- 3 , which consisted of 7 years of primary education , 4 years of secondary education , 2 years of high school and 3 -- 5 years of university education . Under the system , which was similar to the British system of education , children began their elementary ( primary ) education at the age of 7 and completed at the age of 13 after sitting for a regional examination known as the East African Certificate of Primary Education ( EACPE ) . After primary education those who passed very well proceeded to secondary school which ended four years later with the writing of the East African Certificate of Education examination ( EACE ) . The highest level of education that qualified one to attend university was attained after two years of high school at that time distinct from secondary school with students sitting for the East African Advanced Certificate of Education ( EAACE ) . Kenya 7 -- 4 -- 2 -- 3 system ( edit ) With the collapse of the East African community in 1977 , Kenya continued with the same system of education but changed the examination names from their regional identity to a national identity . The East African Certificate of Primary Education became the Certificate of Primary Education ( CPE ) , the first time the C.P.E was marked by a computer system , the East African Certificate of Education became the Kenya Certificate of Education ( KCE ) and the East African Advanced Certificate of Education became the Kenya Advanced Certificate of Education ( KACE ) . 8 -- 4 -- 4 Curriculum ( edit ) Main article : 8 - 4 - 4 Curriculum In 1985 President Daniel arap Moi , introduced the 8 -- 4 -- 4 system of education , which adopted 8 years of primary education , 4 years of secondary education and 4 years of university education . With the introduction of the 8 -- 4 -- 4 system CPE became KCPE ( Kenya Certificate of Primary Education ) while KCE became the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education ( KCSE ) . Since 1985 , public education in Kenya has been based on an 8 -- 4 -- 4 system , with eight years of primary education followed by four years of secondary school and four years of college or university . To date , there has been steady growth in the advancement of education in the country . the country boasts of a great number of public and private universities as well as middle - level colleges . British Curriculum ( edit ) Some private schools , however , offer a system of education similar to the British system of education with ordinary level exams , `` O - levels '' taken at the end of 4 years of secondary school and advanced levels `` A-levels '' , taken after two years of high school . Transition rates and overall performance ( edit ) Out of all children in Kenya about 85 percent attend primary school . 75 percent of those who complete primary education proceed to secondary schools and 60 percent of those who complete secondary school proceed to higher institutions of education which include business and vocational institutions , national polytechnics , public and private universities within the country . Over 950,000 Kenyans have furthered their education abroad with a majority of graduates from India , UK , Canada , the United States , Russia and Uganda . Education quality ( edit ) Education quality has recently received a lot of attention in Kenya . The government 's main document in this effort , the Kenya Education Sector Support Programme for 2005 -- 2010 , established the National Assessment Centre ( NAC ) to monitor learning achievement . In 2010 , the NAC released the results of its first assessment . In 2009 , in collaboration with the NAC , Uwezo Kenya conducted an assessment of the basic literacy and numeracy skills of children ages 6 -- 16 . The Annual Learning Assessment ( ALA ) reached villages in 70 out of 158 districts in Kenya and assessed nearly 70,000 children in their homes . The ALA was set at a Standard 2 level , which is the level where students are supposed to achieve basic competency in reading English and Kiswahili and complete simple arithmetic problems . The chart below shows the percent of children who could not read a Standard 2 level paragraph or solve Standard 2 level subtraction problems : Level of Children Assessed Cannot Read English Paragraph Cannot Read Swahili Paragraph Cannot Do Subtraction Standard 2 85 % 79 % Standard 5 27 % 23 % 30 % Standard 8 4 % 4 % 10 % Key findings about education in Kenya , based on the results of the Uwezo 2009 assessment : Literacy levels are low , and are substantially lower in certain regions . Girls tend to perform better in reading English and Kiswahili , while boys tend to perform better in math . Literacy levels are lower in public schools than private schools . Most children can solve real world , `` ethno - mathematics '' problems , while fewer can solve similar math problems in an abstract , pencil and paper format . 5 % of children are not enrolled in school , but the problem is far worse in particular regions . About half of children are enrolled in pre-school . Many children are older than expected for their class level , including 40 % of children in class 2 , and 60 % of children in class 7 . North Eastern Province and arid districts in Rift Valley and Eastern Provinces have particularly low performance ; and many older children , especially girls , are not attending school . Many families pay for extra tuition , which focuses heavily on drilling and exam preparation . Schools struggle to plan their budgets because they receive funds at unpredictable times . Children whose mothers are educated , particularly beyond primary school , tend to have much higher rates of literacy and numeracy . About 15 % of students are absent on a given day , with much higher absenteeism in certain districts as a result of increased poverty level . There is a severe shortage of teachers , estimated at 4 teachers per school . The reluctance of the government to invest in educational institutions in marginalised areas thereby developing schools in cities only which result in inefficient education process in arid and semi-arid areas embezzlement of public funds by school administrators and lack of accountability of the use of government grants and high levels of corruption in educational institutions Primary education ( edit ) Primary education in Kenya begins at the age of 5 to 7 after completion of a year of kindergarten commonly known as Nursery School or pre-unit . The first class or year of primary school is known as Standard 1 , the final year as Standard 8 and primary school children are known as pupils . The school year at both primary and secondary levels , begins in January and ends in November . Students get 3 school vacations in April , August and December . At the end of the school year students advance to the next grade. Since repetition was banned students still progress to the next grade even though they fail their examinations . Most primary schools are day schools with pupils living at home . Fewer schools at primary level are boarding schools compared to secondary schools . All public primary school pupils sit for the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education examination at the end of the school year in Standard eight . In primary school , students are taught English , Kiswahili and Indigenous language activities . In January 2003 President Mwai Kibaki re-introduced free primary education which previously existed before the mid 80s when the government adopted cost sharing measures that led to a minor level of school fees charged by primary schools for text books , PTA , and extra curricular activities . Since 2003 , education in public schools became free and compulsory ( Kenya Constitution , Article 53 , 2010 ) . On learning that primary education had once again become free in Kenya , Kimani Maruge , an uneducated farmer and the world 's oldest person to enroll in primary school joined Kapkenduiywo primary school in Eldoret at the age of 84 . He was elected head boy at the age of 86 in 2005 . Secondary education ( edit ) Secondary schools in Kenya fall into three categories -- government funded , harambee and private . Government funded schools are divided into national , provincial and district levels . Harambee schools do not receive full funding from the government and private schools are run by private organisations or individuals . After taking the primary school leaving exam and successfully passing , government funded schools select students in order of scores . Students with the highest scores gain admission into national schools while those with average scores are selected into provincial and district schools . Harambee schools accept students with low scores . Students who fail their examinations pursue technical and vocational education . The latter is divided into technical secondary school ( lasting 4 years ) and apprenticeships solutions . Since 2010 , technical secondary schools student can have access to university programs . A number of students also drop out of school by choice due to poor scores . Under the current system , students attend secondary school for four years before sitting for the school leaving exam at the end of the fourth year . The first class or year of secondary school is known as form 1 and the final year is form 4 . At the end of the fourth year , from October to November students sit for the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examination . In 2008 , the government introduced plans to offer free Secondary education to all Kenyans . Historic prestigious national high schools include Mang'u High School , Alliance High School ( Kenya ) and Starehe Boys ' Centre and School . Private secondary schools in Kenya are generally high cost , offering students an alternative system of education with better or more luxurious facilities compared to public schools . They are often favoured for prestige . Most private schools in Kenya offer the British system of education which includes `` O - levels '' and `` A-levels '' . Very few offer the American system of education and good number of them offer the Kenya system . Some of the oldest private schools in Kenya include Loreto Convent Msongari , Nairobi ( 1921 ) , St. Mary 's School , Nairobi , Braeburn School , Consolata School , Strathmore School , Oshwal Academy , Rift Valley Academy , Aga Khan Academy , Kenton College and Brookhouse School , KCSE grading system ( edit ) Grade A - B+ B - C+ C - D+ D - Points 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 The average grade is based on performance in the eight subjects . Where a candidate sits for more than eight subjects , the average grade is based on the best eight subjects . University matriculation is based on the best eight and performance in particular subjects relevant to degree courses . Example below : Subject Group Grade Points English B+ 10 Kiswahili A - 11 Mathematics 12 History & Government 9 Geography A - 11 Physics B+ 10 Chemistry B - 8 Biology A - 11 The total number of points is 81 . The average grade is 81 divided by 8 , which equals 10.1 ( approximately 10.0 points ) which is Grade B+ according to the grading system . This student qualifies to join one of the Public Universities for his good score . Training institutions and faculties and departments determine their own minimum entry requirements . Students who manage a grade of C+ qualify to do a degree course at the university . Owing to competition , and fewer places at the University , those with B and in a few cases B - , and above are taken for degree courses at the public universities and benefit by paying government - subsidised fees . The rest join private universities or middle - level colleges . Interestingly ( hilariously ) the number of students admitted to public universities through J.A.B. depends on the total number of BEDS available in all the public universities . Nonetheless , those who miss out but attained the minimum university entry mark of C+ or C with a relevant diploma certificate are admitted through the parallel degree programmes ( module II ) if they can afford the full fees for the course . This has been the subject of much discussion with people questioning the rationale and morality of locking out qualified students from public institutions yet still admitting those who come from financially able families . Technical and vocational education and training institutions ( edit ) These are two - or three - year post secondary school institutions also termed colleges . They award certificates , diplomas and higher national diplomas after successful completion of relevant courses . Courses offered by these institutions include Business Education , Accounting , Secretarial Studies , Nursing , Teacher Training , Computer Studies , Journalism , Media , Design , Culinary Studies , Foreign Languages , Tourism and Technical Skills . In order of credibility or accreditation , national polytechnics rank first , followed by government training institutes , teacher training colleges and private institutions . Although generally termed colleges , these institution do not award degrees . Degrees are only awarded by universities . From July 2014 , all government and private institutions offering Technical and Vocational Education and Training where put under `` TVETA '' . Retrieved 10 October 2016 ... this act normalized this sector as it had become tainted by unaccredited institutions offering substandard education as revealed by `` The Standard '' . and `` The Star '' . 2 December 2015 . As of October 10 , 2016 there were 540 isntitutions accredited by the Authority Government TVET Institutions ( edit ) There are three types of government TVET institutions in Kenya . these are ; National Polytechnics , Technical Institutions and Vocational Education Centers ( formerly Youth Polytechnics ) Notable Institutions include Technical University of Kenya Technical University of Mombasa Rift Valley Technical Training_Institute University education ( edit ) See also : List of universities and colleges in Kenya and Academic ranks in Kenya There are 48 universities in Kenya , 22 of which are public and 26 private .

( October 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) In 2003 the Kenyan government promised free primary education to its citizens . In the early 70s primary school fees were abolished but in the mid 80s cost - sharing measures between the government and its citizens led to the re-introduction of minor fee charges by primary schools . As the trend continued with schools requiring parents to pay fees such as PTA , harambee , textbooks , uniforms , caution fees , exam fees and extracurricular activity fees , most parents became overburdened and unable to raise such fees . Those who could not afford the money to pay for their children 's school fees often had their children drop out of the school . Many children were also forced to drop out of school when teachers would not allow them to take exams . To pressurise parents to pay fees , schools often sent children home during the final exams . The growth of Kenya 's education sector has exceeded expectations . After the first university was established in 1970 , six other public universities and 23 private universities have been established . Although Kenya has its own universities , some parents prefer to send their children to universities outside the country . This is largely because Kenyan public universities are not as flexible with admission requirements as some foreign universities . Another factor that has been pointed out is that youth with disabilities are facing major obstacles to progress in higher education , and measures as affirmative action or measures tailored to the needs of particular profiles of students could play a relevant role in this .

            "Document Text: FIFA World Cup top goalscorers - wikipedia FIFA World Cup top goalscorers Miroslav Klose celebrating his record - breaking 16th World Cup goal More than 2,500 goals have been scored at the 21 editions of the FIFA World Cup final tournaments , not counting penalties scored during shoot - outs . Since the first goal scored by French player Lucien Laurent at the 1930 FIFA World Cup , more than 1,250 footballers have scored goals at the World Cup , of which just 97 have scored at least five . Number of goalscorers Goals ≥ 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 Total No players 7 6 9 7 8 26 34 > 50 > 90 > 200 > 750 > 1,250 Ronaldo is the player with the second most goals , scoring 15 . The top goalscorer of the inaugural competition was Argentina 's Guillermo Stábile with eight goals . Since then , only 22 players have scored more at all the games played at the World Cup than Stábile did throughout the 1930 tournament . The first was Hungary 's Sándor Kocsis with eleven in 1954 . At the next tournament , France 's Just Fontaine improved on this record with 13 goals in only six games . Gerd Müller scored 10 for West Germany in 1970 and broke the overall record when he scored his 14th goal at the World Cup during West Germany 's win at the 1974 final . His record stood for more than three decades until Ronaldo 's 15 goals between 1998 and 2006 for Brazil . Germany 's Miroslav Klose went on to score a record 16 goals across four consecutive tournaments between 2002 and 2014 . Only two other players have surpassed 10 goals at the World Cup : Pelé with 12 between 1958 and 1970 for Brazil , and Jürgen Klinsmann with 11 between 1990 and 1998 for Germany . Of all the players who have played at the World Cup , only six have scored , on average , at least two goals per game played : Kocsis , Fontaine , Stábile , Russia 's Oleg Salenko , Switzerland 's Josef Hügi , and Poland 's Ernst Wilimowski -- the latter scored four in his single World Cup game in 1938 . The top 97 goalscorers have represented 28 nations , with 14 players scoring for Brazil , and another 14 for Germany or West Germany . In total , 64 footballers came from UEFA ( Europe ) , 29 from CONMEBOL ( South America ) , and only four from elsewhere : Cameroon , Ghana , Australia , and the United States . Fontaine holds the record for the most goals scored at a single tournament , with 13 goals in 1958 . The players that came closest to this record were Kocsis in 1954 , Müller in 1970 and Portugal 's Eusébio in 1966 , with 11 , 10 and 9 , respectively . The lowest scoring tournament 's top scorer was in 1962 , when six players tied at only four goals each . Across the 21 editions of the World Cup , 30 footballers have been credited with the most tournament goals , and no one has achieved this feat twice . Nine of them scored at least seven goals in a tournament , while Brazil 's Jairzinho became in 1970 the only footballer to score at least seven goals without being the top goalscorer of that tournament . These 30 top goalscorers played for 19 nations , the most ( five ) for Brazil . Another five came from other South American countries , with the remaining 20 coming from Europe . Excluding the 2010 edition , all the top tournament scorers won the Golden Boot .

His ratio is 4.00 as he scored four goals in his only World Cup appearance , in 1938 . Jump up ^ FIFA initially credited Leônidas with eight goals in the 1938 tournament , but in November 2006 however , FIFA revised it to seven ( he scored one additional goal in the 1934 tournament ) . Jump up ^ There was a controversy regarding the number of goals scored by Ademir in 1950 because of incomplete data from the final group round game against Spain , that ended in a 6 -- 1 victory for Brazil . The fifth Brazilian goal was credited to Jair , but is now credited to Ademir . Jump up ^ FIFA initially credited Nejedlý with only four goals in 1934 . However , FIFA changed it to five goals in November 2006 , meaning he scored a total of seven goals overall ( he scored two goals in 1938 ) . Jump up ^ Davor Šuker was part of Yugoslavia 's squad in the 1990 FIFA World Cup but did not play any games . After Yugoslavia split , he joined the Croatian national team . Jump up ^ The two initial games of the 1930 FIFA World Cup ( France -- Mexico and United States -- Belgium ) were played at the same time , as seven players scored , with André Maschinot scoring two goals . The order in which these players are listed reflects the actual elapsed time in the games when their goals were scored .

The tournament consists of two parts , the qualification phase and the final phase , officially called the World Cup Finals . The qualification phase , which currently takes place over the three years preceding the Finals , is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals . The current format of the Finals involves 32 teams competing for the title , at venues within the host nation ( or nations ) over a period of about a month . The World Cup Finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world , with an estimated over 1 billion people watching the 2014 tournament final . Brazil is the most successful national team in the history of the World Cup , having won five titles , earning second - place , third - place and fourth - place finishes twice each . Brazil is one of the countries besides Argentina , Spain and Germany to win a FIFA World Cup away from its continent ( Sweden 1958 , Mexico 1970 , USA 1994 and South Korea / Japan 2002 ) . Brazil is the only national team to have played in all FIFA World Cup editions without any absence or need for playoffs . Brazil also has the best overall performance in World Cup history in both proportional and absolute terms with a record of 73 victories in 109 matches played , 124 goal difference , 237 points and only 18 losses . Traditionally , Brazil 's greatest rival is Argentina . The two countries have met each other four times in the history of the FIFA World Cup , with two wins for Brazil ( West Germany 1974 and Spain 1982 ) , one for Argentina ( Italy 1990 ) and a draw ( Argentina 1978 ) . The country that played most against Brazil in the finals is Sweden : 7 times , with five wins for Brazil and two draws . Three other historical rivals are Italy , which lost two World Cup finals against Brazil and eliminated the Brazilians in two tournaments ( France 1938 and Spain 1982 ) , France , which has eliminated Brazil on three occasions ( Mexico 1986 , France 1998 and Germany 2006 ) , and the Netherlands , which has eliminated Brazil at two of their five meetings ( West Germany 1974 and South Africa 2010 ) and won the third place match in Brazil 2014 .

Two other awards were given between 1994 and 2006 : The Most Entertaining Team award for the team that has entertained the public the most , during the World Cup final tournament , as determined by a poll of the general public ; An All - Star Team comprising the best players of the tournament chosen by the technical study group . Golden Ball ( edit ) The Golden Ball award is presented to the best player at each FIFA World Cup finals , with a shortlist drawn up by the FIFA technical committee and the winner voted for by representatives of the media . Those who finish as runners - up in the vote receive the Silver Ball and Bronze Ball awards as the second and third most outstanding players in the tournament respectively . The current award was introduced in the 1982 FIFA World Cup , sponsored by Adidas and France Football , though fifa.com also lists in their player articles as `` golden ball winners '' Kempes , Cruyff , Pelé , Bobby Charlton , Garrincha and Didi for 1978 , 1974 , 1970 , 1966 , 1962 and 1958 respectively . Barcelona is the only club whose players have won the Golden Ball a record 3 times ( Johan Cruyff in 1974 , Romário in 1994 , Lionel Messi in 2014 ) . Golden Ball World Cup Golden Ball Silver Ball Bronze Ball 1930 Uruguay José Nasazzi Guillermo Stábile José Leandro Andrade 1934 Italy Giuseppe Meazza Matthias Sindelar Oldřich Nejedlý 1938 France Leônidas Silvio Piola György Sárosi 1950 Brazil Zizinho Juan Alberto Schiaffino Ademir 1954 Switzerland Ferenc Puskás Sándor Kocsis Fritz Walter 1958 Sweden Didi Pelé Just Fontaine 1962 Chile Garrincha Josef Masopust Leonel Sánchez 1966 England Bobby Charlton Bobby Moore Eusébio 1970 Mexico Pelé Gérson Gerd Müller 1974 West Germany Johan Cruyff Franz Beckenbauer Kazimierz Deyna 1978 Argentina Mario Kempes Paolo Rossi Dirceu 1982 Spain Paolo Rossi Falcão Karl - Heinz Rummenigge 1986 Mexico Diego Maradona Harald Schumacher Preben Elkjær Larsen 1990 Italy Salvatore Schillaci Lothar Matthäus Diego Maradona 1994 United States Romario Roberto Baggio Hristo Stoichkov 1998 France Ronaldo Davor Šuker Lilian Thuram 2002 Korea / Japan Oliver Kahn Ronaldo Hong Myung - bo 2006 Germany Zinedine Zidane Fabio Cannavaro Andrea Pirlo 2010 South Africa Diego Forlán Wesley Sneijder David Villa 2014 Brazil Lionel Messi Thomas Müller Arjen Robben 2018 Russia Luka Modrić Eden Hazard Antoine Griezmann Golden Boot ( edit ) The Golden Boot or Golden Shoe Award goes to the top goalscorer of the FIFA World Cup . While every World Cup had a ranking of the goalscorers , the first time an award was given was in 1982 , under the name Golden Shoe . It was rechristened Golden Boot in 2010 . FIFA sometimes lists the top goalscorers of previous Cups among the Golden Boot winners . If there is more than one player with the same number of goals , since 1994 the tie - breaker goes to the player without a penalty goal , if none has a penalty then the tie breaker goes to the person with more assists - with the FIFA Technical Study Group deciding whether an assist is to be counted as such . If there is still more than one player , the tie - breaker since 2006 goes to the player who has played the least amount of time , which translates to a higher goal average .

However , FIFA changed it to five goals in November 2006 , making Nejedlý the outright top scorer . Jump up ^ FIFA initially credited Leônidas with eight goals . However , in November 2006 , FIFA confirmed that in the quarter - final tie against Czechoslovakia , he had scored once , not twice as FIFA had originally recorded , meaning he had scored only seven goals in total . Jump up ^ There was controversy regarding the number of goals Brazilian Ademir had scored in 1950 , as a result of incomplete data concerning the Final Round game Brazil vs. Spain ( 6 -- 1 ) . The 5 -- 0 goal had been credited to Jair , but is now credited to Ademir . Jump up ^ Salenko is the only player to win the award playing for a team that were eliminated in the group stages .

The award was introduced with the name Lev Yashin Award in 1994 , in honor of the late Soviet goalkeeper . The FIFA Technical Study Group recognises the top goalkeeper of the tournament based on the player 's performance throughout the final competition . Although goalkeepers have this specific award for their position , they are still eligible for the Golden Ball as well , as when Oliver Kahn was awarded in 2002 . In the event of a tie , the Golden Glove Award goes to the goalkeeper who progressed furthest in the competition . The next tiebreakers are saves made , then minutes played .

From 1982 to 1990 , it had been a golden trophy based on Sport Billy , a football - playing cartoon character from 1982 who became an icon for FIFA Fair play . Ever since 1994 , it is simply a trophy with an elegant footballer figure .

The ways in which the FIFA All - Star team members have been chosen has varied from year to year . A technical study group consisting of journalists - mostly from Europe and South America - and experts has historically chosen the team . However , in 1994 FIFA decided to add an official squad , chosen by the FIFA technical group and under the brand name MasterCard All - Star Team . For 1998 , 2002 and 2006 , substitute and reserve members were also nominated for full 22 and 23 - player squads . The All - Star team wound up dropped prior to the 2010 tournament - coincidentally , three years after FIFA changed its sponsorship from MasterCard to Visa .

            "Document Text: FIFA World Cup awards - wikipedia FIFA World Cup awards This is the latest accepted revision , reviewed on 29 October 2018 . This article is about the men 's senior tournament . For the women 's tournament , see FIFA Women 's World Cup awards . At the end of each FIFA World Cup final tournament , several awards are presented to the players and teams which have distinguished themselves in various aspects of the game . Contents 1 Awards 2 Golden Ball 3 Golden Boot 4 Golden Glove 5 Best Young Player Award 6 FIFA Fair Play Trophy 7 Man of the Match 8 Most Entertaining Team 9 All - Star Team 10 Goal of the Tournament 11 References 12 External links Awards ( edit ) There are currently five post-tournament awards , and one given during the tournament : the Golden Ball ( currently commercially termed `` adidas Golden Ball '' ) for best player , first awarded in 1982 ; the Golden Boot ( currently commercially termed `` adidas Golden Boot '' , previously known as the `` adidas Golden Shoe '' from 1982 to 2006 ) for top goal scorer , first awarded in 1982 ; the Golden Glove Award ( currently commercially termed `` adidas Golden Glove '' ; previously known as the `` Lev Yashin Award '' from 1994 to 2006 ) for best goalkeeper , first awarded in 1994 ; the Best Young Player ( currently commercially termed as `` Hyundai Best Young Player '' ) award for best player under 21 years of age at the start of the calendar year , first awarded in 2006 ; the FIFA Fair Play Trophy for the team that advanced to the second round with the best record of fair play , first awarded in 1970 ; the Man of the Match Award ( currently commercially termed as `` Budweiser Man of the Match '' ) for outstanding performance during each game of the tournament , first awarded in 2002 . Two other awards were given between 1994 and 2006 : The Most Entertaining Team award for the team that has entertained the public the most , during the World Cup final tournament , as determined by a poll of the general public ; An All - Star Team comprising the best players of the tournament chosen by the technical study group . Golden Ball ( edit ) The Golden Ball award is presented to the best player at each FIFA World Cup finals , with a shortlist drawn up by the FIFA technical committee and the winner voted for by representatives of the media . Those who finish as runners - up in the vote receive the Silver Ball and Bronze Ball awards as the second and third most outstanding players in the tournament respectively . The current award was introduced in the 1982 FIFA World Cup , sponsored by Adidas and France Football , though fifa.com also lists in their player articles as `` golden ball winners '' Kempes , Cruyff , Pelé , Bobby Charlton , Garrincha and Didi for 1978 , 1974 , 1970 , 1966 , 1962 and 1958 respectively . Barcelona is the only club whose players have won the Golden Ball a record 3 times ( Johan Cruyff in 1974 , Romário in 1994 , Lionel Messi in 2014 ) . Golden Ball World Cup Golden Ball Silver Ball Bronze Ball 1930 Uruguay José Nasazzi Guillermo Stábile José Leandro Andrade 1934 Italy Giuseppe Meazza Matthias Sindelar Oldřich Nejedlý 1938 France Leônidas Silvio Piola György Sárosi 1950 Brazil Zizinho Juan Alberto Schiaffino Ademir 1954 Switzerland Ferenc Puskás Sándor Kocsis Fritz Walter 1958 Sweden Didi Pelé Just Fontaine 1962 Chile Garrincha Josef Masopust Leonel Sánchez 1966 England Bobby Charlton Bobby Moore Eusébio 1970 Mexico Pelé Gérson Gerd Müller 1974 West Germany Johan Cruyff Franz Beckenbauer Kazimierz Deyna 1978 Argentina Mario Kempes Paolo Rossi Dirceu 1982 Spain Paolo Rossi Falcão Karl - Heinz Rummenigge 1986 Mexico Diego Maradona Harald Schumacher Preben Elkjær Larsen 1990 Italy Salvatore Schillaci Lothar Matthäus Diego Maradona 1994 United States Romario Roberto Baggio Hristo Stoichkov 1998 France Ronaldo Davor Šuker Lilian Thuram 2002 Korea / Japan Oliver Kahn Ronaldo Hong Myung - bo 2006 Germany Zinedine Zidane Fabio Cannavaro Andrea Pirlo 2010 South Africa Diego Forlán Wesley Sneijder David Villa 2014 Brazil Lionel Messi Thomas Müller Arjen Robben 2018 Russia Luka Modrić Eden Hazard Antoine Griezmann Golden Boot ( edit ) The Golden Boot or Golden Shoe Award goes to the top goalscorer of the FIFA World Cup . While every World Cup had a ranking of the goalscorers , the first time an award was given was in 1982 , under the name Golden Shoe . It was rechristened Golden Boot in 2010 . FIFA sometimes lists the top goalscorers of previous Cups among the Golden Boot winners . If there is more than one player with the same number of goals , since 1994 the tie - breaker goes to the player without a penalty goal , if none has a penalty then the tie breaker goes to the person with more assists - with the FIFA Technical Study Group deciding whether an assist is to be counted as such . If there is still more than one player , the tie - breaker since 2006 goes to the player who has played the least amount of time , which translates to a higher goal average . Top Goalscorer World Cup Top goalscorer Goals Runners - up Goals Third place Goals 1930 Uruguay Guillermo Stábile 8 Pedro Cea 5 Bert Patenaude 1934 Italy Oldřich Nejedlý 5 Edmund Conen Angelo Schiavio None -- 1938 France Leônidas 7 György Sárosi Gyula Zsengellér Silvio Piola 5 1950 Brazil Ademir 8 Óscar Míguez Alcides Ghiggia Chico Estanislau Basora Telmo Zarra 1954 Switzerland Sándor Kocsis 11 Josef Hügi Max Morlock Erich Probst 6 None -- 1958 Sweden Just Fontaine 13 Pelé Helmut Rahn 1962 Chile Flórián Albert Valentin Ivanov Garrincha Vavá Dražan Jerković Leonel Sánchez None -- 1966 England Eusébio 9 Helmut Haller 6 Valeriy Porkujan Geoff Hurst Ferenc Bene Franz Beckenbauer 1970 Mexico Gerd Müller 10 Jairzinho 7 Teófilo Cubillas 5 1974 West Germany Grzegorz Lato 7 Andrzej Szarmach Johan Neeskens 5 None 1978 Argentina Mario Kempes 6 Teófilo Cubillas Rob Rensenbrink 5 Golden Shoe World Cup Golden Shoe Goals Silver Shoe Goals Bronze Shoe Goals 1982 Spain Paolo Rossi 6 Karl - Heinz Rummenigge 5 Zico 1986 Mexico Gary Lineker Emilio Butragueño Careca Diego Maradona None 1990 Italy Salvatore Schillaci Tomáš Skuhravý Roger Milla Gary Lineker 1994 United States Oleg Salenko Hristo Stoichkov None -- Kennet Andersson Romário 5 1998 France Davor Šuker Gabriel Batistuta Christian Vieri 5 None 2002 South Korea / Japan Ronaldo 8 Miroslav Klose Rivaldo 2006 Germany Miroslav Klose 5 Hernán Crespo Ronaldo Golden Boot World Cup Golden Boot Goals Silver Boot Goals Bronze Boot Goals 2010 South Africa Thomas Müller 5 David Villa 5 Wesley Sneijder 5 2014 Brazil James Rodríguez 6 Thomas Müller 5 Neymar 2018 Russia Harry Kane Antoine Griezmann Romelu Lukaku Notes Jump up ^ FIFA initially credited Nejedlý with only four goals , which would make him joint top scorer with Angelo Schiavio of Italy and Edmund Conen of Germany . However , FIFA changed it to five goals in November 2006 , making Nejedlý the outright top scorer . Jump up ^ FIFA initially credited Leônidas with eight goals . However , in November 2006 , FIFA confirmed that in the quarter - final tie against Czechoslovakia , he had scored once , not twice as FIFA had originally recorded , meaning he had scored only seven goals in total . Jump up ^ There was controversy regarding the number of goals Brazilian Ademir had scored in 1950 , as a result of incomplete data concerning the Final Round game Brazil vs. Spain ( 6 -- 1 ) . The 5 -- 0 goal had been credited to Jair , but is now credited to Ademir . Jump up ^ Salenko is the only player to win the award playing for a team that were eliminated in the group stages . His six goals are the only international goals he ever scored . Jump up ^ Despite the assist tiebreaker , Salenko and Stoichkov remained tied with 6 goals and one assist each , and both received the Golden Shoe . Jump up ^ Romário and Andersson surpassed the other two players with five goals ( Jürgen Klinsmann and Roberto Baggio ) by having three assists each . Jump up ^ Both runners - up had the same number of assists , and each received the Silver Shoe . Jump up ^ During the tournament , after the group stage match against Costa Rica , Ronaldo logged a protest against the crediting of a goal as an own goal , and FIFA granted him the change . ^ Jump up to : Eight players had scored three goals . Ronaldo , Crespo and Zinedine Zidane stood out for having one assist , and then the two recipients were determined by less playtime ( 308 minutes for Crespo , 411 for Ronaldo , 559 for Zidane ) . ^ Jump up to : Müller , Villa , Sneijder and Diego Forlán tied with five goals . Müller won by virtue of having more assists ( 3 ) than the rest ( each had one ) . Villa won the Silver Boot due to playing fewer minutes than Sneijder , and Sneijder won the Bronze Boot due to having played fewer minutes than Forlán . Jump up ^ Neymar , Lionel Messi and Robin van Persie all had four goals in the tournament . Neymar received the Bronze Boot for playing fewer minutes than his competitors ( 480 ; Messi played 693 minutes , and Van Persie , 548 ) . ^ Jump up to : Griezmann , Lukaku , Denis Cheryshev , Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappé tied with 4 goals . Griezmann won the Silver Boot by virtue of having more assists ( 2 ) than the rest ( Lukaku had one , the rest had zero ) . Lukaku won the Bronze Boot due to having more assists ( one ) than Cheryshev , Ronaldo or Mbappé ( zero ) . Golden Glove ( edit ) The Golden Glove Award is awarded to the best goalkeeper of the tournament . The award was introduced with the name Lev Yashin Award in 1994 , in honor of the late Soviet goalkeeper . The FIFA Technical Study Group recognises the top goalkeeper of the tournament based on the player 's performance throughout the final competition . Although goalkeepers have this specific award for their position , they are still eligible for the Golden Ball as well , as when Oliver Kahn was awarded in 2002 . In the event of a tie , the Golden Glove Award goes to the goalkeeper who progressed furthest in the competition . The next tiebreakers are saves made , then minutes played . World Cup Golden Glove 1994 United States Michel Preud'homme 1998 France Fabien Barthez 2002 Korea / Japan Oliver Kahn 2006 Germany Gianluigi Buffon 2010 South Africa Iker Casillas 2014 Brazil Manuel Neuer 2018 Russia Thibaut Courtois Although the Golden Glove Award was first awarded in 1994 , every All - Star Team in World Cups prior to 1998 except 1990 included only one goalkeeper . World Cup All - Star Goalkeeper 1930 Uruguay Enrique Ballestrero 1934 Italy Ricardo Zamora 1938 France František Plánička 1950 Brazil Roque Máspoli 1954 Switzerland Gyula Grosics 1958 Sweden Harry Gregg 1962 Chile Viliam Schrojf 1966 England Gordon Banks 1970 Mexico Ladislao Mazurkiewicz 1974 West Germany Sepp Maier 1978 Argentina Ubaldo Fillol 1982 Spain Dino Zoff 1986 Mexico Jean - Marie Pfaff 1990 Italy Luis Gabelo Conejo Sergio Goycochea Best Young player award ( edit ) The Best Young Player award was awarded for the first time at the 2006 World Cup in Germany and given to Germany 's Lukas Podolski . The award is given to the best player in the tournament who is at most 21 years old . For the 2018 World Cup , this meant that the player had to have been born on or after 1 January 1997 . The election took place on FIFA 's official World Cup website with the help of The FIFA Technical Study Group . FIFA organised a survey on the Internet for users to choose the `` best young player '' of the World Cup , between 1958 and 2002 , named the best young player of each tournament . With 61 % of the overall vote , the winner was Pelé , who finished ahead of the Peruvian Teófilo Cubillas , the best young player at Mexico 1970 , and England 's Michael Owen , who reached similar heights at France 98 . YPA World Cup Best Young Player Age 1958 Sweden Pelé 17 1962 Chile Flórián Albert 20 1966 England Franz Beckenbauer 20 1970 Mexico Teófilo Cubillas 21 1974 West Germany Władysław Żmuda 20 1978 Argentina Antonio Cabrini 1982 Spain Manuel Amoros 21 1986 Mexico Enzo Scifo 20 1990 Italy Robert Prosinečki 21 1994 United States Marc Overmars 1998 France Michael Owen 18 2002 Korea / Japan Landon Donovan 20 2006 Germany Lukas Podolski 21 2010 South Africa Thomas Müller 20 2014 Brazil Paul Pogba 21 2018 Russia Kylian Mbappé 19 FIFA Fair play trophy ( edit ) The FIFA Fair Play Trophy is given to the team with the best record of fair play during the World Cup final tournament since 1970 . Only teams that qualified for the second round are considered . The winners of this award earn the FIFA Fair Play Trophy , a diploma , a fair play medal for each player and official , and $50,000 worth of football equipment to be used for youth development . The appearance of the award was originally a certificate .

            "Document Text: FIFA World Cup awards - wikipedia FIFA World Cup awards This is the latest accepted revision , reviewed on 27 July 2018 . This article is about the men 's senior tournament . For the women 's tournament , see FIFA Women 's World Cup awards . At the end of each FIFA World Cup final tournament , several awards are presented to the players and teams which have distinguished themselves in various aspects of the game . Contents 1 Awards 2 Golden Ball 3 Golden Boot 4 Golden Glove 5 Best Young Player Award 6 FIFA Fair Play Trophy 7 Man of the Match 8 Most Entertaining Team 9 All - Star Team 10 Goal of the Tournament 11 References 12 External links Awards There are currently five post-tournament awards , and one given during the tournament : the Golden Ball ( currently commercially termed `` adidas Golden Ball '' ) for best player , first awarded in 1982 ; the Golden Boot ( currently commercially termed `` adidas Golden Boot '' , previously known as the `` adidas Golden Shoe '' from 1982 to 2006 ) for top goal scorer , first awarded in 1982 ; the Golden Glove Award ( currently commercially termed `` adidas Golden Glove '' ; previously known as the `` Lev Yashin Award '' from 1994 to 2006 ) for best goalkeeper , first awarded in 1994 ; the Best Young Player ( currently commercially termed as `` Hyundai Best Young Player '' ) award for best player under 21 years of age at the start of the calendar year , first awarded in 2006 ; the FIFA Fair Play Trophy for the team that advanced to the second round with the best record of fair play , first awarded in 1970 ; the Man of the Match Award ( currently commercially termed as `` Budweiser Man of the Match '' ) for outstanding performance during each game of the tournament , first awarded in 2002 . Two other awards were given between 1994 and 2006 : The Most Entertaining Team award for the team that has entertained the public the most , during the World Cup final tournament , as determined by a poll of the general public ; An All - Star Team comprising the best players of the tournament chosen by the technical study group . Golden Ball The Golden Ball award is presented to the best player at each FIFA World Cup finals , with a shortlist drawn up by the FIFA technical committee and the winner voted for by representatives of the media . Those who finish as runners - up in the vote receive the Silver Ball and Bronze Ball awards as the second and third most outstanding players in the tournament respectively . The current award was introduced in the 1982 FIFA World Cup , sponsored by Adidas and France Football , though fifa.com also lists in their player articles as `` golden ball winners '' Kempes , Cruyff , Pelé , Bobby Charlton , Garrincha and Didi for 1978 , 1974 , 1970 , 1966 , 1962 and 1958 respectively . Barcelona is the only club whose players have won the Golden Ball a record 3 times ( Johan Cruyff in 1974 , Romário in 1994 , Lionel Messi in 2014 ) . Golden Ball World Cup Golden Ball Silver Ball Bronze Ball 1930 Uruguay José Nasazzi Guillermo Stábile José Leandro Andrade 1934 Italy Giuseppe Meazza Matthias Sindelar Oldřich Nejedlý 1938 France Leônidas Silvio Piola György Sárosi 1950 Brazil Zizinho Juan Alberto Schiaffino Ademir 1954 Switzerland Ferenc Puskás Sándor Kocsis Fritz Walter 1958 Sweden Didi Pelé Just Fontaine 1962 Chile Garrincha Josef Masopust Leonel Sánchez 1966 England Bobby Charlton Bobby Moore Eusébio 1970 Mexico Pelé Gérson Gerd Müller 1974 West Germany Johan Cruyff Franz Beckenbauer Kazimierz Deyna 1978 Argentina Mario Kempes Paolo Rossi Dirceu 1982 Spain Paolo Rossi Falcão Karl - Heinz Rummenigge 1986 Mexico Diego Maradona Harald Schumacher Preben Elkjær Larsen 1990 Italy Salvatore Schillaci Lothar Matthäus Diego Maradona 1994 United States Romario Roberto Baggio Hristo Stoichkov 1998 France Ronaldo Davor Šuker Lilian Thuram 2002 Korea / Japan Oliver Kahn Ronaldo Hong Myung - bo 2006 Germany Zinedine Zidane Fabio Cannavaro Andrea Pirlo 2010 South Africa Diego Forlán Wesley Sneijder David Villa 2014 Brazil Lionel Messi Thomas Müller Arjen Robben 2018 Russia Luka Modrić Eden Hazard Antoine Griezmann Golden Boot The Golden Boot or Golden Shoe Award goes to the top goalscorer of the FIFA World Cup . While every World Cup had a ranking of the goalscorers , the first time an award was given was in 1982 , under the name Golden Shoe . It was rechristened Golden Boot in 2010 . FIFA sometimes lists the top goalscorers of previous Cups among the Golden Boot winners . If there is more than one player with the same number of goals , since 1994 the tie - breaker goes to the player without a penalty goal , if none has a penalty then the tie breaker goes to the person with more assists - with the FIFA Technical Study Group deciding whether an assist is to be counted as such . If there is still more than one player , the tie - breaker since 2006 goes to the player who has played the least amount of time , which translates to a higher goal average .

However , FIFA changed it to five goals in November 2006 , making Nejedlý the outright top scorer . Jump up ^ FIFA initially credited Leônidas with eight goals . However , in November 2006 , FIFA confirmed that in the quarter - final tie against Czechoslovakia , he had scored once , not twice as FIFA had originally recorded , meaning he had scored only seven goals in total . Jump up ^ There was controversy regarding the number of goals Brazilian Ademir had scored in 1950 , as a result of incomplete data concerning the Final Round game Brazil vs. Spain ( 6 -- 1 ) . The 5 -- 0 goal had been credited to Jair , but is now credited to Ademir . Jump up ^ Salenko is the only player to win the award playing for a team that were eliminated in the group stages . His six goals are the only international goals he ever scored . Jump up ^ Despite the assist tiebreaker , Salenko and Stoichkov remained tied with 6 goals and one assist each , and both received the Golden Shoe . Jump up ^ Romário and Andersson surpassed the other two players with five goals ( Jürgen Klinsmann and Roberto Baggio ) by having three assists each . Jump up ^ Both runners - up had the same number of assists , and each received the Silver Shoe . Jump up ^ During the tournament , after the group stage match against Costa Rica , Ronaldo logged a protest against the crediting of a goal as an own goal , and FIFA granted him the change . ^ Jump up to : Eight players had scored three goals . Ronaldo , Crespo and Zinedine Zidane stood out for having one assist , and then the two recipients were determined by less playtime ( 308 minutes for Crespo , 411 for Ronaldo , 559 for Zidane ) . ^ Jump up to : Müller , Villa , Sneijder and Diego Forlán tied with five goals . Müller won by virtue of having more assists ( 3 ) than the rest ( each had one ) . Villa won the Silver Boot due to playing fewer minutes than Sneijder , and Sneijder won the Bronze Boot due to having played fewer minutes than Forlán . Jump up ^ Neymar , Lionel Messi and Robin van Persie all had four goals in the tournament . Neymar received the Bronze Boot for playing fewer minutes than his competitors ( 480 ; Messi played 693 minutes , and Van Persie , 548 ) . ^ Jump up to : Griezmann , Lukaku , Denis Cheryshev , Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappé tied with 4 goals . Griezmann won the Silver Boot by virtue of having more assists ( 2 ) than the rest ( Lukaku had one , the rest had zero ) . Lukaku won the Bronze Boot due to having more assists ( one ) than Cheryshev , Ronaldo or Mbappé ( zero ) . Golden Glove The Golden Glove Award is awarded to the best goalkeeper of the tournament . The award was introduced with the name Lev Yashin Award in 1994 , in honor of the late Soviet goalkeeper . The FIFA Technical Study Group recognises the top goalkeeper of the tournament based on the player 's performance throughout the final competition . Although goalkeepers have this specific award for their position , they are still eligible for the Golden Ball as well , as when Oliver Kahn was awarded in 2002 . Although the Golden Glove Award was first awarded in 1994 , every All - Star Team in World Cups prior to 1998 except 1990 included only one goalkeeper . In the event of a tie , the Golden Glove Award goes to the goalkeeper who progressed furthest in the competition . The next tiebreakers are saves made , then minutes played .

The award is given to the best player in the tournament who is at most 21 years old . For the 2018 World Cup , this meant that the player had to have been born on or after 1 January 1997 . The election took place on FIFA 's official World Cup website with the help of The FIFA Technical Study Group . FIFA organised a survey on the Internet for users to choose the `` best young player '' of the World Cup , between 1958 and 2002 , named the best young player of each tournament . With 61 % of the overall vote , the winner was Pelé , who finished ahead of the Peruvian Teófilo Cubillas , the best young player at Mexico 1970 , and England 's Michael Owen , who reached similar heights at France 98 .

Only teams that qualified for the second round are considered . The winners of this award earn the FIFA Fair Play Trophy , a diploma , a fair play medal for each player and official , and $50,000 worth of football equipment to be used for youth development . The appearance of the award was originally a certificate . From 1982 to 1990 , it had been a golden trophy based on Sport Billy , a football - playing cartoon character from 1982 who became an icon for FIFA Fair play . Ever since 1994 , it is simply a trophy with an elegant footballer figure . Peru was the first nation to win the award after receiving no yellow or red cards in the 1970 FIFA World Cup held in Mexico . Peru 's FIFA Fair Play trophy award . Peru won the award after receiving no yellow or red cards in the tournament .

The ways in which the FIFA All - Star team members have been chosen has varied from year to year . A technical study group consisting of journalists - mostly from Europe and South America - and experts has historically chosen the team . However , in 1994 FIFA decided to add an official squad , chosen by the FIFA technical group and under the brand name MasterCard All - Star Team . For 1998 , 2002 and 2006 , substitute and reserve members were also nominated for full 22 and 23 - player squads . The All - Star team wound up dropped prior to the 2010 tournament - coincidentally , three years after FIFA changed its sponsorship from MasterCard to Visa .

            "Document Text: Robert Anderson Van Wyck - wikipedia Robert Anderson Van Wyck Robert Anderson Van Wyck 91st Mayor of New York City In office January 1 , 1898 -- December 31 , 1901 Preceded by William L. Strong Succeeded by Seth Low Personal details ( 1849 - 07 - 20 ) July 20 , 1849 New York City , New York , U.S. November 14 , 1918 ( 1918 - 11 - 14 ) ( aged 69 ) Paris , France Nationality American Robert Anderson Van Wyck ( / væn ˈwaɪk / van WYKE ; July 20 , 1849 -- November 14 , 1918 ) was the first mayor of New York City after the consolidation of the five boroughs into the City of Greater New York in 1898 . Contents ( hide ) 1 Early life and education 2 Career 3 Political career 4 Later years 5 Legacy 6 References 7 Further reading 8 External links Early life and education ( edit ) Robert Anderson Van Wyck was the son of William Van Wyck and Lydia Ann Maverick . He was one of seven children , including two brothers Augustus and Samuel Maverick , a Confederate Regimental Surgeon . He studied at the Wilson Academy in North Carolina , and later graduated from Columbia University , where he was valedictorian of his class . His sister Lydia married Robert Hoke of North Carolina , a Confederate general during the American Civil War and businessman . Career ( edit ) Van Wyck began working in business , then studied law and became an attorney . He enjoyed a large practice for many years before entering politics . His business life depended on his social connections as well . Van Wyck was a member of the Holland Society , of which he became President . He belonged to many of the social clubs of the city , and was prominent in Masonic circles , being a member of The Ancient Lodge , New York City . Political career ( edit ) For many years Van Wyck took an active interest in Democratic Party matters , attending many conventions , state and national . Later , Van Wyck was elected Judge of the City Court of New York . He advanced to Chief Justice . Van Wyck resigned as justice to accept the Democratic Party nomination for Mayor of New York City . He was elected in 1897 by a very large majority . He served as mayor of New York City between 1898 and 1901 , as the first mayor to govern New York City after its five boroughs had been consolidated into a single city . As Mayor , he brought together the innumerable municipal corporations comprising the greater city , adjusting their finances and bringing order out of almost total chaos . He directed construction of the Interborough Rapid Transit , the first subway in Manhattan , and provided for the construction of the proposed Brooklyn Tunnel . Van Wyck is generally regarded as a colorless mayor , selected by the leaders of Tammany Hall as a man who would do little to interfere with their running of the city . Initially highly popular as a result of his reversal of the various reforms introduced by the preceding Fusion administration , Van Wyck 's administration foundered on the so - called ' Ice Trust ' scandal of 1900 . The New York World reported that the American Ice Company of Charles W. Morse planned to double the price of ice , from 30 to 60 cents per hundred pounds ( from 66 cents to 1.32 dollars per 100 kilograms ) . In the era before refrigeration , this had potentially fatal effects , as ice was the only preservative available to keep food , milk , and medicines fresh . The high price would have put ice beyond reach of many of the city 's poor -- Tammany 's main power base in the years of waves of immigration . American Ice was forced to reverse its decision due to the public outcry . Van Wyck 's political rivals forced an investigation into the issue . It revealed that American Ice had secured an effective monopoly over the supply of its product to the city -- it was the only company with rights to land ice at New York piers -- and would have dramatically increased its profits at the new price . In addition , Van Wyck , whose salary as mayor was only $15,000 , owned , and had apparently not paid for , $680,000 worth of American Ice stock . The Ice Trust Scandal destroyed Van Wyck 's political career and was generally reckoned to have cost Tammany the elections of 1901 , which was won by the Fusion reformist slate led by Seth Low . Two years later , the New York Times characterized the Van Wyck administration as one mired in `` black ooze and slime '' . Governor Theodore Roosevelt initiated an investigation , which determined that Van Wyck had not been personally implicated in the Ice Trust Scandal . Later years ( edit ) Van Wyck and his wife enjoyed traveling . In 1906 , they moved to Paris , France . He died there at the age of 69 on November 14 , 1918 . The funeral was held at American Holy Trinity Church . His body was returned to New York and he was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx , New York City .

Highway 407 Route information Maintained by Province of Ontario 407 ETR Concession Company Limited Length 138.7 km ( 86.2 mi ) History Proposed 1959 -- 1986 , Opened June 7 , 1997 -- June 20 , 2016 Major junctions West end Highway 403 / Queen Elizabeth Way -- Burlington Highway 403 -- Mississauga , Oakville Highway 401 -- Milton Highway 410 -- Brampton Highway 427 Highway 400 -- Toronto , Barrie Highway 404 -- Toronto , Newmarket Highway 412 -- Whitby East end Taunton Road - Oshawa Highway system Ontario provincial highways List 400 - series Former ← Highway 406 Highway 409 → King 's Highway 407 ( pronounced `` four - oh - seven '' ) is a tolled 400 - series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario . Comprising a privately leased segment as well as a publicly owned segment , the route begins in Burlington and travels through the Greater Toronto Area ( GTA ) suburbs of Oakville , Mississauga , Brampton , Vaughan , Markham , Pickering and Whitby before ending in Clarington north of Bowmanville . The segment between Burlington and Brougham in Pickering is leased to and operated by the 407 ETR Concession Company Limited and is officially known as the 407 Express Toll Route ( 407 ETR ) . It begins at the junction of the Queen Elizabeth Way ( QEW ) and Highway 403 in Burlington , and travels 107.9 km ( 67.0 mi ) across the GTA to Brock Road in Pickering . East of Brock Road the freeway continues east as Highway 407 East ( Highway 407E ) , a toll route operated by the provincial government , for 30.8 km ( 19.1 mi ) to Taunton Road in Clarington . Highway 407 is the first electronically operated toll highway opened in the world ; there are no toll booths along the length of the route . Distances are calculated automatically using transponders or licence plates , which are scanned at entrance and exit points . Major interchanges along the route include the QEW , Highway 403 , Highway 401 , Highway 410 , Highway 427 , Highway 400 , Highway 404 , and Highway 412 . Highway 407 was planned in the late 1950s as a freeway bypassing the Toronto segment of Highway 401 , the busiest highway in the world . However , construction did not begin until 1987 . During the early 1990s , the provincial government proposed tolling the highway to alleviate a revenue shortfall . The central sections of Highway 407 opened 1997 . The remaining sections were built quickly over the following four years , with the final segment of opening in mid-2001 . Despite being included in the 400 - series network , the Highway 407 ETR section is not considered part of the provincial highway network due to it now being privately operated . The route is operated privately under a 99 - year lease agreement with the provincial government . The lease was sold in 1998 for approximately C $ 3.1 billion to a consortium of Canadian and Spanish investors operating under the name 407 International Inc . The privatization of the Highway 407 ETR section has been the source of significant criticism , especially regarding the increases in tolls , plate denial , and false charges . In addition , the safety of segments constructed following the sale of the freeway has been called into question . Many have come to regard Highway 407 ETR as a luxury , as opposed to the bypass of Highway 401 it was originally conceived to be . The first phase of a provincially owned and tolled extension of the route , known solely as Highway 407 ( and not as Highway 407 ETR ) opened to traffic from Brock Road in Pickering to Harmony Road in Oshawa on June 20 , 2016 . Included as part of this extension was construction of a tolled north - south link between Highways 401 and 407 known as Highway 412 . Construction is currently underway to extend the provincially owned portion of Highway 407 easterly to Highway 35 / Highway 115 in Clarington . This construction is being completed in two stages , with the first phase opening on January 2 , 2018 as a 9.6 km extension to Taunton Road , and the second phase opening in 2020 . This construction includes an additional link to Highway 401 east of Oshawa that will be known as Highway 418 . Even though the highway does not enter the City of Toronto proper , Toronto is used as a control city in Halton and Durham Regions due to the similar sizes of the suburban municipalities the highway passes through making selection of an obvious example among them difficult .

Although the general public felt that tolling made the highway a luxury rather than its original purpose of relieving traffic on Highway 401 , Highway 407 ETR has had average daily trip counts of over 350,000 vehicles in June 2014 . The 407 ETR is contractually responsible for maintaining high traffic levels as justification for increasing tolls , but conduct their own traffic studies . Despite increased usage , parallel roads that Highway 407 was intended to supplement continue to grow congested , forcing the MTO to revisit costly widening projects of Highway 401 and the QEW . Highway 407 has been designed with aesthetics and environmental concerns in mind by featuring landscaped embankments , 79 storm drainage ponds , as well as a curb and gutter system . Unlike most other Ontario highways , it features concrete pavement as opposed to top - coated asphalt . Because of this , the high - mast lighting along the urban portions of the route feature fewer luminaires than asphalt - surfaced freeways . Burlington -- Brampton ( edit ) Highway 407 begins in Burlington within Halton Region at the Freeman Interchange between Highway 403 and the QEW , from which it branches off northward . The six - lane route passes under Brant Street , Upper Middle Road and Guelph Line ( Halton Regional Road 1 ) before it interchanges with Dundas Street ( Halton Regional Road 5 and former Highway 5 ) . It briefly enters greenspace as it curves gently to the northeast , avoiding the nearby Niagara Escarpment . The route is crossed by Walkers Line , east of which residential subdivisions line the south side and greenspace lines the north . At an interchange with Appleby Line ( Halton Regional Road 20 ) , the highway straightens and travels parallel to Dundas Street before passing over Bronte Creek and under the Canadian National Railway 's ( CN ) Halwest Subdivision . Highway 407 south of Highway 401 ; this section follows a north -- south alignment to Highway 403 East of Bronte Creek , Highway 407 enters an agricultural area , interspersed with woodlots . It enters Oakville at the Tremaine Road ( Halton Regional Road 22 ) overpass , then gradually swerves to the north as it encounters an interchange with Bronte Road ( Halton Regional Road 25 and former Highway 25 ) . The route crosses Sixteen Mile Creek just north of Glenarchy Conservation Area , then travels parallel to the creek for several kilometres . It swerves north after an interchange with Neyagawa Boulevard , near the hamlet of Glenarchy . After diverging from the creek , it curves northeast , parallel to and north of Burnhamthorpe Road , where it interchanges with Trafalgar Road ( Halton Regional Road 3 ) . Highway 407 then encounters Highway 403 at a large interchange where curves sharply to the northwest ; Highway 403 , meanwhile , curves from the southeast to the northeast . Now travelling parallel to and immediately west of the Halton -- Peel regional boundary and Oakville -- Mississauga city boundary , the six - lane Highway 407 progresses northwest alongside a power transmission corridor , with subdivisions to the east and greenspace to the west . The route continues as such northwest to Highway 401 , passing under Lower Base Line ( which continues east as Eglinton Avenue ) and interchanging at Britannia Road and Derry Road before crossing the Canadian Pacific Railway 's ( CP ) Galt Subdivision . At Highway 401 , the route makes a sharp curve to the northeast , while ramps weave across both freeway over several kilometres , interconnecting them . It enters Peel Region at the Winston Churchill Boulevard ( Peel Regional Road 19 ) overpass and follows another power transmission corridor just north of the Brampton -- Mississauga boundary . Highway 407 and Derry Road , facing southwest ; this sections of Highway 407 parallels the boundary between Mississauga ( at left ) and Milton ( at right ) . Highway 407 swerves east and encounters an interchange with Mississauga Road ( Peel Regional Road 1 ) just prior to crossing the Credit River and the Orangeville Brampton Railway , after which it enters the urban GTA . After passing interchanges with Mavis Road ( Peel Regional Road 18 ) and Hurontario Street ( Former Highway 10 ) , the route encounters Highway 410 at another sprawling interchange located over Etobicoke Creek . Over the next 7 kilometres ( 4.3 mi ) , the route nudges northward into Brampton , interchanging with Dixie Road ( Peel Regional Road 4 ) and Bramalea Road , as well as a CN railway line , before crossing Steeles Avenue ( Peel Regional Road 15 ) . Highway 407 curves back to the northeast as it interchanges with Airport Road ( Peel Regional Road 7 ) and passes beneath another CN line , before encountering the final interchange in Peel Region at Goreway Drive . It crosses the West Humber River and former Highway 50 in Claireville Conservation Area before curving east into York Region . Vaughan -- Pickering ( edit ) Highway 407 facing east toward Pine Valley Drive , in Vaughan Immediately after crossing into Vaughan , Highway 407 encounters the first of three large interchanges with other 400 - series highways in York Region . The Highway 427 interchange is a four - level partial stack located just north of Steeles Avenue in Vaughan and adjacent to the 407 ETR Concession Company offices . The interchange features weaved ramps which connect to former Highway 27 , located just east . The route continues eastward , parallel and between Steeles Avenue and Highway 7 . It dives through the Humber River valley alongside a CN line and along the northern border of Thackeray Conservation Lands , passing beneath a CP line . After an interchange with Pine Valley Drive ( York Regional Road 57 ) , the route becomes sandwiched between the industrial lands of the Pine Valley Business Park and the Emery Creek Corporate Park . A partial interchange with Weston Road ( York Regional Road 56 ) lies just west of the large four - level stack interchange with Highway 400 , the only of its kind in Ontario . An interchange with Jane Street ( York Regional Road 55 ) is interwoven into the east side of the Highway 400 interchange , below which pass the tunnels of the Line 1 Yonge -- University subway , with the Highway 407 station , with its large commuter parking lot and GO Transit bus terminal serving the highway corridor , located to the south . Highway 407 at Woodbine Avenue Still travelling alongside a power transmission corridor , Highway 407 crosses a complex rail wye which provides access to the CN freight yards to the north . After interchanging with Keele Street ( York Regional Road 6 ) , the route gently curves northward , passing under the CN Newmarket Subdivision , which carries the GO Transit Barrie Line and crossing the Don River . It curves back eastward as it interchanges with Dufferin Street ( York Regional Road 53 ) , travelling adjacent and south of Highway 7 . After interchanges with Bathurst Street ( York Regional Road 38 ) and Yonge Street ( York Regional Road 1 ) , the Vaughan -- Markham boundary , Highway 407 crosses the CN Bala Subdivision , which carries the GO Transit Richmond Hill Line . After an interchange with Bayview Avenue ( York Regional Road 34 ) , the highway swerves south . A partial interchange with Leslie Street ( York Regional Road 12 ) precedes the third and final large freeway -- freeway junction at Highway 404 . East of Highway 404 , the freeway travels generally parallel to the Rouge River . It interchanges with Woodbine Avenue ( York Regional Road 8 ) and Warden Avenue ( York Regional Road 65 ) , east of which the route travels alongside a CN line and crosses the GO Transit Unionville Line . Highway 407 continues straight eastward into a residential area , interchanging with Kennedy Road ( York Regional Road 3 ) , McCowan Road ( York Regional Road 67 ) and Markham Road ( York Regional Road 68 ) where it crosses the river and diverges from both the CN line and power transmission corridor . The route interchanges with Ninth Line ( York Regional Road 69 ) and Donald Cousens Parkway ( York Regional Road 48 ) before exiting the urban GTA and curving northeast over a CP line and into Rouge Park . Construction in 2015 of the overpass and off - ramp at Harmony Road in Durham Region , the temporary terminus of the highway from June 20 , 2016 until January 2 , 2018 . Until the opening of the first phase of 407E in June 2016 , the final interchange along Highway 407 was with York -- Durham Line ( York / Durham Regional Road 30 ) , the boundary between York Region and Durham Region as well as Markham and Pickering . The route curves eastward then crosses West Duffins Creek north of the community of Whitevale and south of the future Pickering Airport and planned community of Seaton . Sandwiched between farm fields , the highway is crossed by North Road , where a future interchange is planned , and Sideline 24 . Highway 407 ended just south of Brougham at a signalized intersection with Brock Road ( Durham Regional Road 1 ) until the end of 2015 , where it continued eastward as Highway 7 . A new interchange has been built in conjunction with the provincially maintained and tolled extension , Highway 407E , which was constructed east of this point , and ties in with the current freeway , eliminating the at - grade intersection . Pickering -- Oshawa ( edit ) 407 ETR Ends at Brock Road where ON 407 begins Immediately east of Brock Road , this tollway falls under the ownership of the Province of Ontario and is now referred to as Ontario Highway 407 ( Or Highway 407 East ) instead of 407 ETR . This route runs parallel to both Highway 7 and Durham Regional Road 3 ( with some crossovers ) through the North of Pickering , Whitby , and Oshawa , until its eastern terminus at the proposed interchange between Highway 418 and Taunton Road . A major interchange of this route includes with Highway 412 , which is a spur connecting the 407 with Highway 401 in Whitby . Both the 407 East Extension , as far as Harmony Road in Oshawa. and Highway 412 opened to traffic on June 20 , 2016 . The highway will be further extended eastward through Clarington by 2020 . The tolls along this portion of the highway began on February 1 , 2017 . Tolls ( edit ) Along with transponders , The 407 uses cameras and licence plate recognition technology to toll vehicles Unlike most other toll highways , Highway 407 features no toll booths . Rather , a system of cameras and transponders allows for automatic toll collection . It is one of the earliest examples of a highway to exclusively use open road tolling . Highway 407 is otherwise designed as a normal freeway ; interchanges connect directly to surface streets . A radio antenna detects when a vehicle with a transponder has entered and exited the highway , calculating the toll rate . For vehicles without a transponder , an automatic number plate recognition system is used . In both cases , monthly statements are mailed to users . The automatic number plate recognition system is linked to several provincial and U.S. state motor vehicle registries . Toll rates are set by both the 407 ETR and the Province of Ontario for each of the respective sections they own . However , the province set out limitations in the 407 ETR lease contract for maintaining traffic volumes to justify toll rates . Despite this , rates have increased annually against the requests of the provincial government , resulting in several court battles and the general public regarding the route as a luxury . Plate denial ( edit ) As part of the contractual agreement with the government , the MTO is required to deny licence plate validation stickers to drivers who have an outstanding 407 ETR bill over 125 days past due . This process was temporarily halted in February 2000 due to numerous false billing claims . Following a judicial decision by the Ontario Divisional Court on November 7 , 2005 , the Ontario Registrar of Motor Vehicles was ordered to begin denying the validation or issue of Canadian license plates and vehicle permits for 407 ETR users who have failed to pay owed fees . On November 22 , 2005 , the MTO announced that it would appeal the decision but would begin to deny plates until the appeal was decided . On February 24 , 2006 , the Ontario Court of Appeals denied the government leave to appeal the 2005 decision . As a result , plate denial remains in place . Rates ( edit ) Users of both 407 ETR and Highways 407E / 412 / 418 will only receive one bill invoice , with trips on each highway specified . 407 ETR Transponders are compatible with Highways 407E , 412 , and later 418 . 407 ETR ( edit ) All dollar amounts listed are Canadian dollars . EB = eastbound , WB = westbound The rate rose for tolls in 2018 . As of February 1 , 2018 , the base tolls for driving on the 407 ETR are as follows : Duty Class Light Heavy Heavy Multi-unit Zone Time Off peak 23.38 ¢ / km 46.76 ¢ / km 70.14 ¢ / km Midday ( Weekdays ) 33.81 ¢ / km 67.62 ¢ / km $1.01 / km Midday ( Weekends & Holidays ) 30.83 ¢ / km 61.66 ¢ / km 92.49 ¢ / km Peak Period ( a.m. ) EB WB 39.33 37.08 39.57 38.49 39.21 ¢ 36.38 39.21 78.66 74.16 79.14 76.98 78.42 ¢ 72.76 78.42 $1.18 $1.11 $1.19 $1.15 $1.18 $1.09 $1.18 Peak Hours ( a.m. ) EB WB 47.09 42.18 46.66 43.78 46.24 44.60 41.39 46.24 94.18 84.36 93.32 87.56 92.48 89.20 82.78 92.48 $1.41 $1.27 $1.40 $1.31 $1.39 $1.34 $1.24 $1.39 Peak Period ( p.m. ) EB WB 38.11 42.55 41.05 42.55 42.17 ¢ 40.68 37.75 76.22 85.10 82.10 85.10 84.34 ¢ 81.36 75.50 $1.14 $1.28 $1.23 $1.28 $1.27 $1.22 $1.13 Peak Hours ( p.m. ) EB WB 43.30 51.00 49.21 48.34 50.55 47.91 48.76 42.89 86.60 $1.02 98.42 96.68 $1.01 95.82 97.52 85.78 $1.30 $1.53 $1.48 $1.45 $1.52 $1.44 $1.46 $1.29 Minimum Charge ( vehicle with transponder ) Peak N / A $19.85 / journey $36.95 / journey Off Peak $12.80 / journey $23.85 / journey Accessory Charge Trip Toll $1 / journey $2 / journey $3 / journey Additional Charge Journey Without Transponder Video Toll $4.15 / journey * $50.00 / journey * * $50.00 / journey * * Account Fee $3.95 Transponder Lease Annually $23.50 Monthly $3.95 Starting February 1 , 2018 , there are 4 zones : 1 from QEW to 401 , 2 from 401 to 427 , 3 from 427 to 404 and 4 from 404 to 407E ( Brock Rd . ) The toll rate that applies to a specific trip is determined by the time at which a vehicle enters the highway . Off peak rates are in effect from 19 : 00 - 06 : 00 Monday to Friday except public holidays , and 19 : 00 - 11 : 00 Saturday , Sunday and holidays . Midday weekday rates are in effect from 10 : 00 - 14 : 30 , Mondays to Fridays except for holidays . Midday weekend / holiday rates are in effect from 11 : 00 - 19 : 00 , Saturday , Sunday and holidays . Peak period rates are in effect from 06 : 00 - 07 : 00 , 09 : 00 - 10 : 00 , 14 : 30 - 15 : 30 and from 18 : 00 - 19 : 00 , Monday to Friday except for public holidays . Peak hours rates are in effect from 07 : 00 - 09 : 00 and from 15 : 30 - 18 : 00 , Mondays to Fridays except for public holidays . Heavy goods vehicles and lorries are assessed a minimum toll regardless of the length of their trip . * Light goods vehicles without transponders are assessed an additional Video Toll . Motorcycles are not charged a video toll because there is rarely a reasonable place to mount a transponder . * * Heavy duty vehicles are legally required to have transponders in order to use the highway ; offenders may be penalised under the Highway Traffic Act . Highway 407 east ( edit ) Ontario Highway 407 Shield seen travelling along the freeway in Oshawa To compensate for opening delays , tolling of both Highways 407E and 412 did not commence until February 2017 . As of February 1 , 2017 , the following tolls applies for motorists utilizing these tollways . The rate stayed the same in 2018 . These tolls will be applied to Highway 418 upon opening : Time Period Duty Class Light Heavy Heavy Multi-unit Peak ( Weekdays ) ( 6am - 10am and 3pm - 7pm ) 29.00 ¢ / km 58.00 ¢ / km 87.00 ¢ / km Midday ( Weekdays ) ( 10am - 3pm ) 23.00 ¢ / km 46.00 ¢ / km 69.00 ¢ / km Midday ( Weekends & Holidays ) ( 11am - 7pm ) 22.00 ¢ / km 44.00 ¢ / km 66.00 ¢ / km Off Peak ( Weekdays ) ( 7pm - 6am ) 19.00 ¢ / km 38.00 ¢ / km 57.00 ¢ / km Off Peak ( Weekends & Holidays ) ( 7pm - 11am ) 19.00 ¢ / km 38.00 ¢ / km 57.00 ¢ / km All end times displayed are rounded up to the nearest minute for simplicity purposes ( i.e. 6am is actually 5 : 59 : 59am ) The toll rate that applies to a specific trip is determined by the time at which a vehicle enters the highway . Heavy goods vehicles and lorries are assessed a minimum toll regardless of the length of their trip : $3.00 off peak , $5.00 during peak hours . As seen above , the costs of utilizing these provincially owned tollways are less than that of the 407 ETR . Light vehicles without transponders may be assessed an additional Video Toll . Vehicles weighing over 5,000 kilograms are divided into two categories : Heavy Single Units and Heavy Multiple Units . Heavy Multiple Unit Vehicles will be charged two or three time the passenger rate , depending on the size of the vehicle . All Heavy Unit vehicles are legally required to have transponders in order to use the highways ; offenders may be penalized under the Highway Traffic Act . History ( edit ) Planning and initial construction ( edit ) Although construction of Highway 407 did not begin until 1987 , planning for the bypass of Highway 401 north of Toronto began in the late - 1950s . Concepts for the new `` dual highway '' first appeared in the 1959 plan for Metropolitan Toronto . Land adjacent to several hydro corridors was acquired for the future freeway in the 1960s , but sat vacant as the Ontario Department of Highway ( predecessor to the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario ( MTO ) opted instead to widen Highway 401 to a twelve - lane collector - express system . The Highway 401 expansion project was considered a success and construction of Highway 407 was shelved for almost thirty years . The plan was revisited in the mid-1980s as congestion in Toronto pushed roads beyond capacity . In 1986 , Premier David Peterson was given a helicopter tour of the city during rush - hour ; construction of the highway was announced soon thereafter , and began in 1987 . The Ontario government 's normal process for highway construction was not possible given the financial constraints of the recession of the early 1990s . The Peterson government sought out private sector partnerships and acquired innovative electronic tolling technology . Two firms bid on the project , with the Canadian Highways International Corporation being selected as the operator of the highway . Financing for the highway was to be paid by user tolls lasting 35 years , after which it would return to the provincial system as a toll - free 400 - series highway . The succeeding government of Bob Rae announced on March 31 , 1995 , that the corridor reserved for Highway 403 between Burlington and Oakville would instead be built as a western extension of Highway 407 . The first segment of Highway 407 , between Highway 410 and Highway 404 , was ceremoniously opened to traffic on June 7 , 1997 ; no tolls were charged for a month to allow motorists to test - drive the freeway . Several other sections were well underway at this point . A 13 - kilometre ( 8.1 mi ) extension westwards to Highway 401 was opened just months later on December 13 , 1997 . That section was connected with Highway 403 to the south on September 4 , 1998 , with a temporary two lane ramp connecting to Trafalgar Road . In the east , an extension to Markham Road , at what was then the southern terminus of Highway 48 , was completed in early 1998 . However , due to the protest of local residents and officials concerning traffic spill - off ( a scenario revisited with the extension to Oshawa ) , the freeway was opened only as far as McCowan Road on February 18 . The short segment from McCowan Road to Markham Road remained closed for over a year , as locals feared the funneling of traffic onto Main Street , which is named Markham Road south of the freeway . Both Markham and McCowan were widened to four lanes between Highway 407 and Steeles Avenue at this time . This did not alleviate concerns , but on June 24 , 1999 , the extension opened to continued protest regardless .

Headquarters Vaughan , Ontario , Canada Owners Cintra ( 43.23 % ) CPP Investment Board ( 40 % ) SNC - Lavalin ( 16.77 % ) Website www.407etr.com When Mike Harris was elected Premier in 1995 on his platform of the Common Sense Revolution , the Ontario government faced a $11 billion annual deficit and a $100 billion debt . Seeking to balance the books , a number of publicly owned services were privatized over the following years . Although initially spared , Highway 407 was sold quickly in the year leading up to the 1999 provincial elections . The highway was leased to a conglomerate of private companies for $3.1 billion . The Ontario corporation , known as 407 International Inc. , is jointly owned by the Spanish multinational Cintra Infraestructuras ( 43.23 % ) , as well as various subsidiaries of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board ( 40 % ) and the Montreal - based engineering firm SNC - Lavalin ( 16.77 % ) . The deal included a 99 - year lease agreement with unlimited control over the highway and its tolls , dependent on traffic volume ; however , the government maintains the right to build a transport system within the highway right - of - way . When purchased , the highway travelled from the junction of Highway 403 in Mississauga to Markham Road in Markham . Extensions westward to the QEW and eastward to Highway 7 and Brock Road in Pickering were constructed by the corporation , as mandated in the lease agreement . The western extension , from Highway 403 southwest to the QEW , was not part of the original Highway 407 concept in 1987 ; rather , the corridor was originally intended to connect the Hamilton and Mississauga sections of Highway 403 . Highway 407 was originally slated to assume the temporary routing for Highway 403 along the Mississauga - Oakville boundary to end at the QEW . However , the Bob Rae led Ontario government altered these plans in 1995 , and the corporation constructed this section quickly upon obtaining the lease . Sections opened throughout the middle of 2001 : between Neyagawa Boulevard and Highway 403 on June 17 ; between Bronte Road and Neyagawa Boulevard on June 29 ; between Dundas Street and Bronte Road on July 18 ; and between the Freeman Interchange and Dundas Street on July 30 . In the east , a final extension between Markham Road and Highway 7 opened a month later on August 30 . On October 5 , 2010 , the Canadian Pension Plan announced that an agreement was reached with the owners of the roadway to purchase 10 % stake for $894 million . This implies a value of close to $9 billion for the highway in its current state . However , in 1998 , MPP E.J. Douglas Rollins found that as much as $104 billion had been spent by the province to that point . Controversy ( edit ) Left - hand exiting can potentially cause problems for drivers , such as weaving across traffic to avoid exiting and being billed for accidentally driving on the highway . Highway 407 ETR has been the subject of several controversies over its two decades of existence . While the privatization of the route and toll rate increases have been routinely criticized by the general public and politicians , cost - savings measures and the ensuing safety concerns resulted in an independent Ontario Provincial Police investigation shortly before the opening of the freeway . Finally , the public has accused the 407 ETR of predatory billing practices , including false billing and continued plate denial after bankruptcy . An expert panel of engineers released a report outlining concerns regarding the decreased loop ramp radii and a lack of protective guardrail at sharp curves , in addition to the lack of a concrete median barrier to separate the opposite directions of travel . However , it was also argued that the large grass median was sufficient to prevent cross-over collisions , given that Highway 410 has a similar median . The Ontario provincial government has quarrelled with 407 ETR over toll rates and customer service , but is largely tied down by the lease contract . On February 2 , 2004 , the government delivered notice to 407 ETR that they are considered to be in default of their contract because of 407 ETR 's decision to raise toll rates without first obtaining provincial clearance . The court 's initial decision sided with 407 ETR : on July 10 , 2004 , an independent arbitrator affirmed that 407 ETR has the ability to raise toll rates without first consulting the government . The government filed an appeal of this decision but was overruled by an Ontario Superior Court decision released on January 6 , 2005 ; however , a subsequent ruling by the Ontario Court of Appeal on June 13 , 2005 granted the government permission to appeal the decision . The government also faced off against 407 ETR in court regarding plate denial around this time . Highway 407 east project ( edit ) See also : Ontario Highway 412 and Ontario Highway 418 Planned routing , including two north - south connector freeways in Durham Region , as part of the eastern extension . A provincially owned 65 - kilometre ( 40 mi ) long extension to the 407 ETR , known as Highway 407 East ( or 407E ) , began construction in 2012 , with the project undertaken in two separate phases . Phase 1 was opened on June 20 , 2016 , consisting of a 22 - kilometre ( 14 mi ) extension to Harmony Road in Oshawa , as well as the 10 - kilometre ( 6.2 mi ) Highway 412 . The extension was free of tolls until February 1 , 2017 . Phase 2A , opened January 2 , 2018 , added a 9.6 - kilometre ( 6.0 mi ) extension to Taunton Road at the future Highway 418 interchange . Phase 2B will add a further 23.3 kilometres ( 14.5 mi ) , consisting of an east - west extension from Taunton Road to Highway 35 and Highway 115 , as well as Highway 418 , the north - south connector to Highway 401 ; Phase 2B is scheduled for completion in 2020 . An environmental assessment ( EA ) to analyze the proposed extension was undertaken in the early 2000s . The assessment also included studies of the two north -- south connectors . A preferred route was announced in June 2007 , and the EA was completed in June 2009 . On March 6 , 2007 , as part of the FLOW initiative , the Government of Canada and the Province of Ontario confirmed the extension of the 407 to Highway 35 and Highway 115 in Clarington , including the connector highways , with an announced completion date of 2013 . On January 27 , 2009 , the provincial government announced that the extension would be a tolled highway but owned by the province and with tolls set by the province . The announcement also indicated that the province expected to issue a Request for Proposals later in the year . The contract , which is valued at $1.6 billion and includes construction and operation of the highway , was eventually awarded to the same consortium that owns 407 ETR . A bridge under construction along Highway 7 west of Brooklin in 2012 ; this was the first project along the new extension . On June 9 , 2010 , the MTO approved the extension as far east as Simcoe Street in Oshawa , announcing plans to phase construction of the extension . Local residents and politicians rejected the plan , as had happened with the section between McCowan Road and Markham Road . A motion was proposed in the Ontario Legislature to build the full extension in one project , but failed to pass . Instead , a compromise was issued on March 10 , 2011 : the first phase would extend Highway 407 to Harmony Road in Oshawa by 2015 , including Highway 412 ; the second phase would then complete the extension to Highway 35 / 115 by 2020 , including Highway 418 . This timeline was confirmed by Premier Dalton McGuinty on May 24 , 2012 , and construction began in the first quarter of 2013 . ON 407 's extension in June 2016 , before its opening In early December 2015 , it was announced that contractor delays would push the opening of the first phase from December 18 to the spring of 2016 . The extension did not open until the morning of June 20 , 2016 , in the last hours of Spring 2016 . Future ( edit ) On December 15 , 2016 , it was mentioned on the Markham Economist and Sun newspaper that the Highway 407 ETR proposes to widen the highway six to eight lanes between Markham Road and York - Durham Line and four to six lanes between York - Durham Line to west of Brock Road . A new Whites Road interchange ( currently Sideline 26 ) will also be built . The widening between York - Durham Line and Brock Road is expected to begin in Spring 2018 . The future town of Seaton is currently under development with the release of development lands in Durham north of the Gatineau Hydro Corridor and west of Brock Road . This development will include the future Pickering Airport , slated for construction in 2020 . An interchange with a future extension of Rossland Road at the current North Road overpass ( near Whitevale ) will be built as part of the large road network planned for the development .

            "Document Text: Lane - wikipedia Lane Jump to : navigation , search This article is about that part of a carriageway used by a single line of traffic . For a narrow road in the countryside , see country lane . For other uses , see Lane ( disambiguation ) . Thru lanes indicated by arrows on California CR G4 ( Montague Expressway ) in Silicon Valley . In the context of traffic control , a lane is part of a roadway ( carriageway ) that is designated for use by a single line of vehicles , to control and guide drivers and reduce traffic conflicts . Most public roads ( highways ) have at least two lanes , one for traffic in each direction , separated by lane markings . On multilane roadways and busier two - lane roads , lanes are designated with road surface markings . Major highways often have two multi-lane roadways separated by a median . Some roads and bridges that carry very low volumes of traffic are less than 15 feet ( 4.6 m ) wide , and are only a single lane wide . Vehicles travelling in opposite directions must slow or stop to pass each other . In rural areas , these are often called country lanes . In urban areas , alleys are often only one lane wide . Urban and suburban one lane roads are often designated for one - way traffic .

Types ( edit ) The Ontario Highway 401 in the Greater Toronto area , with 17 travel lanes in 6 separate carriageways visible in the midground . Turning lane on the Rodovia BR - 101 ( Brazil ) Play media Changing lanes , Gothenburg , Sweden Transfer lanes , connecting surface collector lanes with through lanes between two tunnels A left - turn merging lane in Germany , needing explanation by a crafted sign A traffic lane or travel lane is a lane for the movement of vehicles traveling from one destination to another , not including shoulders . A through lane or thru lane is a traffic lane for through traffic . At intersections , these may be indicated by arrows on the pavement pointing straight ahead . An express lane of a road is used for faster moving traffic and has less access to exits / off ramps . In other areas , an express lane may refer to a HOV lane ( see below ) . A reversible lane ( contraflow lane ) is a lane where the direction of traffic can be changed to match the peak flow . They are used to accommodate periods of high traffic flow , especially rush hour where the flow is predominantly in one direction , on roads that can not be easily widened such as over bridges . One or more lanes are removed from the opposing flow and added to the peak flow . An auxiliary lane is a lane other than a through lane , used to separate entering , exiting or turning traffic from the through traffic . An acceleration lane or merge lane allows traffic entering a highway to accelerate to the speed of through traffic before merging with it . A deceleration lane is a lane adjacent to the primary road or street used to improve traffic safety by allowing drivers to pull out of the through lane and decelerate safely before turning off a surface street or exiting a freeway . A turn lane is set aside for slowing down and making a turn , so as not to disrupt traffic . By removing turning traffic from the through lanes , motorist safety is improved and delay is removed , but crossing distances for pedestrians are lengthened , increasing their exposure to collisions . A two - way center turn lane is a lane in the center of a roadway to allow drivers traveling in either direction to pause before turning across oncoming traffic ( a left turn in right - driving countries , or a right turn in left - driving countries ) while waiting for a gap in traffic . A passing lane is sometimes provided on busy two - lane roads to allow drivers to pass slower vehicles without having to cross the center line and risking a head - on collision . A climbing lane , truck lane , or crawler lane is often provided on steep mountain grades , in order to allow smaller vehicles to pass larger , slower ones . The lane is marked only on the uphill stretch and usually a short distance afterward ( for regaining speed ) . An operational lane or auxiliary lane is an extra lane on the entire length of highway between interchanges , giving drivers more time to merge in or out . The lane is created when an entrance ramp meets the highway , and drops out ( with an `` exit only '' sign ) to become the ramp at the next exit . A transfer lane of a road is used to move from express lanes to collector lanes , or vice versa ; it is somewhat similar to an auxiliary lane . A collector lane of a road is used for slower moving traffic and has more access to exits / off ramps . Dedicated lanes are traffic lanes set aside for particular types of vehicles . A high occupancy vehicle or carpool lane is reserved for carpooling . In the US , they may be marked with a diamond icon every few hundred feet ( hence the nickname `` diamond lane '' ) , or separated from other lanes by double broken white lines , a continuous pair of double yellow lines , or just a single broken white line . A high - occupancy toll lane is a combination of an HOV lane and toll collection technology that allows drivers without passengers to use the HOV lane by paying a premium price for the privilege A designated bicycle lane is a portion of the roadway or shoulder designated for the exclusive or preferential use of bicyclists . This designation is indicated by special word and / or symbol markings on the pavement and `` BIKE LANE '' signs . A motorcycle lane is provided at certain roads and highways such as the Federal Highway in Malaysia to segregate the motorcycle traffic from the main roadways to reduce motorcycle - related accidents . The motorcycle lane may form a part of the hard shoulder , or may be one or more completely separated lanes . A bus lane is reserved for buses providing public transportation on a fixed route , sometimes with overhead catenary for trolleybuses . In some countries , bus lanes may also be used by some other traffic , such as taxis , bicycles and motorbikes . A tram lane is a lane reserved for the use of buses , trams and taxicabs . It is usually encountered in cities with curbside tram network , such as Zagreb . A truckway is a dedicated lane for longer length trucks ; for instance , the Florida Turnpike allows 96 - foot long double trailer combinations , in contrast to normal Florida highways ' 53 - foot limit . Since the major cost of trucking is the fixed cost of the same trailer with its driver the cost per ton of operating with truckway size and weight allowances is 35 to 40 percent below the cost of operations on the non-truckways . In some areas , the lane adjacent to the curb is reserved for non-moving vehicles . A parking lane is reserved for parallel parking of vehicles . A fire lane is the area next to a curb , which is reserved for firefighting equipment , ambulances , or other emergency vehicles . Parking in these areas , often marked by red lines , usually warrants a parking ticket . A loading lane ( loading zone in the United States ) is an area next to a curb , which is reserved for loading and unloading passengers and / or freight . It may be marked by a sign ( `` LOADING ONLY '' or `` LOADING ZONE '' ) or by a yellow or white - painted curb . A hard shoulder is sometimes called an emergency lane or a breakdown lane , when it is reserved for vehicle breakdowns , and for emergency vehicles . On some congested roads , the shoulder is used as a vehicle lane during peak travel hours . By law or custom , inside lanes are often reserved for faster traffic , and outside lanes are used by slower traffic . An overtaking lane is the lane furthest from the shoulder of a multi-lane carriageway / roadway ( sometimes called the fast lane , although this is deprecated by the authorities ) . The slow lane is the lane nearest to the shoulder of a multi-lane carriageway / roadway . These usages lead to the phrases life in the slow lane and life in the fast lane , used to describe relaxed or busy lifestyles , respectively and used as the titles of various books and songs . Lane width ( edit ) While in general , wider lanes are associated with a reduction in crashes , in urban settings both narrow ( less than 2.8 m ) and wide ( over 3.1 ~ 3.2 m ) lanes increase crash risks . Wider lanes ( over 3.3 ~ 3.4 m ) are associated with 33 % higher impact speeds , as well as higher crash rates . Carrying capacity is also maximal at a width of 3 to 3.1 metres ( 9.8 to 10.2 ft ) , both for motor traffic and for bicycles . Pedestrian volume declines as lanes widen , and intersections with narrower lanes provide the highest capacity for bicycles . As lane width decreases , traffic speed diminishes . Advocates for safety of people walking and people on bikes , and many new urbanists disagree with traditional thinking in traffic engineering , saying that safety and capacity are not adversely impacted by reducing lanes widths to as little as 10 feet ( 3.0 m ) . Moreover , wider travel lanes also increase exposure and crossing distance for pedestrians at intersections and midblock crossings . assumed widths and heights in road design for Europe ( in meters ) The widths of vehicle lanes typically vary from 9 to 15 feet ( 2.7 to 4.6 m ) . Lane widths are commonly narrower on low volume roads and wider on higher volume roads . The lane width depends on the assumed maximum vehicle width with an additional space to allow for lateral motion of the vehicle . The maximum truck width had been 96 inches ( 2.438 m ) in the Code of Federal Regulations of 1956 which matches with the width of eight - foot for shipping containers . This had been increased to 102 inches ( 2.591 m ) in 1976 which explicitly states to be read as the slightly larger metric 2.6 metres ( 102.36 in ) width respecting international harmonization . The same applies to standards in Europe which had increased the allowable size of road vehicles with a current maximum of 2.55 metres ( 100.39 in ) for most trucks and allowing 2.6 metres ( 102.36 in ) for refrigerator trucks . The minimum extra space had been 0.20 metres ( 7.87 in ) and it is currently assumed to be at least 0.25 metres ( 9.84 in ) on each side . For roads with a lower amount of traffic it is allowed to build the second or third lane in the same direction to an assumed lower width for cars like 1.75 metres ( 68.90 in ) , however this is not recommended as a design principle for new roads as changes in the amount of traffic could make for unnecessarily increased risks in the future . The Interstate Highway standards for the U.S. Interstate Highway System uses a 12 - foot ( 3.7 m ) standard for lane width , while narrower lanes are used on lower classification roads . In Europe , as laws and road width vary by country , the minimum widths of lanes is generally between 2.5 to 3.25 metres ( 8.2 to 10.7 ft ) . The federal Bundesstraße interurban network in Germany defines a minimum of 3.5 metres ( 11 ft 6 in ) for each lane for the smallest two lane roads with an additional 0.25 metres ( 9.84 in ) on the outer sides and shoulders being at least 1.5 metres ( 59.06 in ) on each side . A modern Autobahn divided highway will have two lanes per direction which are 3.75 metres ( 12 ft 4 in ) wide with an additional clearance of 0.50 metres ( 19.69 in ) on each side , while three lanes per direction are set at 3.75 metres ( 12 ft 4 in ) for the rightmost lane and 3.5 metres ( 11 ft 6 in ) for the other lanes . Urban access roads and roads in low - density areas may have lanes as small as 2.75 metres ( 9 ft 0 in ) in width per lane with shoulders being at least 1 metre ( 3 ft 3 in ) wide . Lane markings ( edit ) Main article : Road surface marking A typical rural American freeway ( Interstate 5 in the Central Valley of California ) . Notice the yellow line on the left , the dashed white line in the middle , and the solid white line on the right . Also note the rumble strip to the left of the yellow line . Painted lane markings vary widely from country to country . In the United States , Canada , Mexico , Honduras , Puerto Rico , Virgin Islands and Norway , yellow lines separate traffic going opposite directions and white separates lanes of traffic traveling the same direction , but such is not the case in many European countries . Lane markings are mostly lines painted on the road by a road marking machine , which can adjust the marking widths according to the lane type . Numbering of freeway lanes in California ( edit ) Traffic reports in California often refer to accidents being `` in the number X lane . '' The California Department of Transportation ( Caltrans ) assigns the numbers from left to right . The far left passing lane is the number 1 lane . The number of the slow lane ( closest to freeway onramps / offramps ) depends on the total number of lanes , and could be anywhere from 2 to 8 . History ( edit ) For much of human history , roads did not need lane markings because most people walked or rode horses at relatively slow speeds . Another reason for not using lane markings is that they are expensive to maintain . When automobiles , trucks , and buses came into widespread use during the first two decades of the 20th century , head - on collisions became more common . Without the guidance provided by lane markings , drivers in the early days often erred in favor of keeping closer to the middle of the road , rather than risk going off - road into ditches or trees . This practice often left inadequate room for opposing traffic . The history of lane markings is connected to the mass automobile construction in Detroit . It resulted in the formation of the first Road Commission of Wayne County , Michigan in 1906 which was trying to make roads safer ( Henry Ford served on the board in the first year ) . The commission would order the construction of the first concrete road in 1909 ( the Woodard Avenue in Detroit ) and it conceived the centerline for highways in 1911 . Hence the chairmen of the Road Commission , Edward N. Hines is widely credited as the inventor of line markings . The introduction as a common standard is connected to June McCarroll , a physician in Indio , California who started experimenting with painting lines on roads in 1917 after she was run off a highway by a truck driver . In November 1924 , after years of lobbying by Dr. McCarroll and her allies , California officially adopted a policy of painting lines on its highways . A portion of Interstate 10 near Indio has been named the Dr. June McCarroll Memorial Freeway in her honor . black center line on an Autobahn in Germany ( late 1930s ) The first lane markings in Europe were painted at an accident hotspot in the small town of Sutton Coldfield near Birmingham , England in 1921 . The success of this experiment made its way to other hotspots and later standardization of white paint for line markings in Great Britain . The first lane markings in Germany were used in Berlin in 1925 using white paint for line markings and road edge markings . When the standard for the new autobahn network was conceived in the 1930s it mandated the usage of black paint for the center line for each carriageway as black was better visible on the bright surface of the concrete roads . By 1939 , lane markings had become so popular that they were officially standardized throughout the United States . The concept of line markings spread throughout the world becoming standard for most roads . Originally the lines were drawn manually with normal paint which would bleach out quickly . After the war , the first machines for line markings were invented and a plastic strip was becoming standard in the 1950s which led to gradually find line markings on all roads .

The inn was built in 1810 , and is one of the oldest operating traveler 's accommodations in the state . It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 . It is well known for its use in exterior shots of the Newhart television series . Contents 1 Description 2 History 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Description ( edit ) The Waybury Inn is located on the north side of East Main Street ( Vermont Route 125 ) , near the eastern end of East Middlebury village . It is set near the westernmost end of one of the major routes across the Green Mountains in central Vermont . It consists of a 2 - 1 / 2 story gable - roofed main block , from which a two - story block extends to the rear . A single - story porch , covered by a hip roof , extends across the front and around to one side . The interior is arranged in a central hall plan , with large rooms , extending the full depth of the main block , on either side of the main staircase . History ( edit ) The inn was built in 1810 by John Foot ( or Foote ) . The pass to the east had opened as a toll road ( turnpike ) in 1808 , and Foot sought to capitalize on the traffic it would bring . However , the turnpike never brought a high volume of traffic , and efforts to develop a glassworks in the village also cramped growth in the area . Moderate growth in the village by 1850 prompted its second proprietor , Royal Farr , to expand the premises in 1867 by adding the ell to the rear . This included a ballroom , and far added other amenities to make the inn a local site for social events . The inn was variously known as the Glen House and Green Mountain House before being given its present name in the 20th century . The only period of time in which the inn was closed was during World War II . The inn maintains a tradition in which , in room 9 , there is an antique desk with a secret drawer . Following the lead of a couple who found the drawer in 1987 , guests often put notes in the drawer . The Waybury Inn was also used as a location for exterior shots on the Bob Newhart television series , Newhart , from 1982 to 1990 . Featured as the Stratford Inn , the Waybury Inn was painted white for the show . After the show went off the air in 1990 , the inn was repainted green to match the nearby Green Mountains .

In 2014 Norwich Airport was the 29th busiest airport in the UK and busiest in the East Anglia region . Norwich Airport has a CAA Public Use Aerodrome Licence ( Number P723 ) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction . Along with a long history of flights to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol via KLM Cityhopper ( formerly KLM UK ) , it offers flights to various destinations in the United Kingdom and Europe . Besides the commercial flights , charter operators also operate out of Norwich . Bristow Helicopters , DanCopter and Babcock Mission Critical Services Offshore fly crews to North Sea gas rigs and SaxonAir operates executive , private aircraft and helicopter charter flights .

It opened in 1933 , and was used by Boulton & Paul for aircraft test flying and other recreational activities . This fell into disuse in the early part of the Second World War , and by the end of it had been too built upon to be used again . RAF Horsham St Faith ( edit ) Main article : RAF Horsham St Faith The current site , formerly known as Royal Air Force Station Horsham St Faith , or more commonly RAF Horsham St Faith , was first developed in 1939 and officially opened on 1st June 1940 as a Royal Air Force ( RAF ) bomber station . In September 1942 Horsham St. Faith was made available to the United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) for use by the Eighth Air Force . The USAAF designated the airfield as Station 123 ( HF ) . The airfield was transferred to RAF Fighter Command on 10th July 1945 when it was occupied by four Gloster Meteor Squadrons . RAF Horsham St. Faith was a front - line RAF station for many years , and its squadrons participated in many post-war exercises . The station was deactivated on 1st August 1963 . Civil Airport ( edit ) Control tower at Norwich International Airport . The RAF left Horsham on 24th March 1967 . Over the following two years the major part of the airfield and buildings were sold to Norwich City and Norfolk County Council , a small part being retained by the Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) . Norwich Airport Ltd. , under ownership of the county and city councils , developed the modern day Norwich International Airport , with the main terminal opening in 1988 . In 1971 the airport began operations with charter flights , with airline Air Anglia creating a base at the airfield offering flights all over northwestern Europe . Their route to Amsterdam is still operated today with KLM Cityhopper . Most of the World War II buildings used by the USAAF remain , although converted for a variety of purposes . Two of the five large pre-war hangars are still being used for aircraft maintenance . One of the other three has been converted into an aviation academy , the remaining two have been converted for commercial use by Air Livery and KLM UK Engineering . The original control tower still exists although the top has been restored and a new tower has been built adjacent to the present main runway . Other wartime buildings now form part of the airport industrial estate ( owned by the county and city councils ) and are intermingled with many newer structures . Adjacent to the airport terminal building opened by the Queen Mother , there is a memorial display relating to the USAAF , consisting of photographs , paintings , and a plaque commemorating the American use of the airfield . Firside Junior School 's Year 6 class refurbished the memorial in July 2014 , in partnership with the Eighth in the East group . The airport also has the City of Norwich Aviation Museum to the north of the site , commemorating the airfield 's history as a military airfield and development as a civil airport through the years , with many civil and military aircraft on display - many of which served from the aerodrome at some point in their lifetime . The former RAF accommodation blocks situated towards Old Catton were until 1993 used by the University of East Anglia as accommodation for students ; known to students as `` Fifers Lane '' halls , these have since been demolished and the site redeveloped as housing . The remaining MoD property -- airmen 's married quarters -- continued to be used for nearby RAF stations , but due to the closure of these stations , the housing has been sold to private buyers . Whilst most runways and taxiways from the military airfield remain , only one runway is primarily used , to avoid takeoffs and landings over built - up areas : east -- west Runway 09 / 27 , which was extended eastwards by the RAF in 1956 to 1841 metres long . The old 04 / 22 runway is no longer used for takeoffs or landings , but is used for parking and taxiing of aircraft . In 1999 , the new corporate identity was launched as Norwich International Airport , kept until April 2017 . In March 2004 , the city and county councils sold 80.1 % of Norwich Airport Ltd. to Omniport whilst retaining the remaining 19.9 % . Omniport has also acquired 100 % of Norwich Airport Travel Ltd . Since the sale to Omniport the airport has become one of the UK hubs for budget airline Flybe and the number of flights and destinations served have rapidly increased . In 2005 a £ 3.5 M terminal expansion programme began . In 2009 , during filming of the BBC show Top Gear , operations from the airport appeared to be disrupted when a caravan , adapted into an airship and flown by James May , drifted overhead the airport , infringing its controlled airspace . In reality , the event occurred after much pre-planning between the airport authorities and the BBC ; and scenes showing the airship in the airfield boundary were actually filmed after it had lifted off from the airfield to satisfy the requirements of the film crew . In 2007 , the airport introduced its Airport Development Fee ( ADF ) . All passengers over 16 departing from the airport pay a fee of £ 10 . The airport was sold by the majority stakeholders of Omniport to the Rigby Group PLC in 2014 , who integrated the airport as part of Regional & City Airports in April 2017 . Recent developments ( edit ) Norwich International Airport announced in 2015 that four new routes were being considered for Department for Transport ( DfT ) funding . The routes being considered included : Dublin Airport ( Flybe , double daily return weekdays , single return weekends ) , Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport ( Flybe , daily return ) , Newcastle Airport ( Links Air , double daily weekday return ) , and Exeter Airport ( Flybe , daily return ) . Links Air proposed a start date of 1st September 2016 , but the airline was put into liquidation . In November 2015 it was announced that bids for routes to Newcastle and Exeter had been successful , with the inaugural flight to the latter on 24th March 2016 , operated by Flybe . Flybe also confirmed plans to operate summer sun and winter ski routes from Norwich Airport as part of a 5 - year deal with the Regional & City Airports ( RCA ) group . From May 2016 , one of Flybe 's 118 - seat Embraer ERJ - 195 aircraft began operating multi-weekly flights from Norwich to Alicante and Málaga . In addition , with effect from its Winter 2016 programme Flybe will also introduce Geneva as a new route from Norwich . In 2016 an engine test facility opened on site , as well as the KLM UK Engineering Academy , opening on 18th April 2017 but an official opening ceremony on 5th August . On 6th July 2017 , Managing Director Richard Pace announced a 30 - year vision to treble passenger numbers at the airport . The plans include raising annual passenger numbers to 930,000 by 2030 , and 1.4 million by 2045 ; forging new routes to Paris Charles de Gaulle and Dublin to boost the choice of worldwide destinations ; constructing a 100 - acre business park for both aviation and non-aviation companies - it was originally frozen by investors in 2015 waiting for the new Northern Distributor Road to be completed ( due March 2018 ) ; extending the Runway 27 / 09 by 500 metres and building new taxiways to boost capacity and allow larger aircraft to operate to the airport . Another 10 - year ambition is seeking permission to allow flights to fly until up to 1 : 30 AM ( currently , the curfew is put in place at 11 : 00 PM ) for four nights a week . Pace says the new Northern Distributor Road is `` unlocking the potential for the site to generate growth for the region and the airport , '' and `` the masterplan sets out the vision for the future development of Norwich Airport and its continued vital role in supporting our region 's ( East Anglia 's ) economy . '' Facilities ( edit ) The airport has one runway ( designated 09 / 27 ) , 1,841 m ( 6,040 ft ) in length . A smaller 1,285 m ( 4,216 ft ) runway ( designated 04 / 22 ) was closed in 2006 , and is now used as a taxiway and parking area for decommissioned aircraft . The airport has nine parking stands for commercial aircraft .

Olsen Airtransport suffered a bird strike on takeoff from Runway 27 . Both engines failed and the aircraft made an emergency landing in a field . All three crew members were injured but the passengers sustained no injuries . The aircraft was written off . On 25th October 1974 a Cessna 310 dived into the ground while on final approach , killing the pilot . The Cessna 's nose pitched down and the wings rolled over ; the loss of control was caused by the uncommanded retraction of the starboard flap , caused by the failure of the drive mechanism . On 04th May 2012 , a KLM Fokker 70 flying from Teesside to Amsterdam suffered an engine failure , causing the pilots to shut it down . The aircraft was diverted to Norwich , where at 11 : 05am it made an emergency landing , taxiing to an empty runway for an integrated emergency plan to be activated . All 45 people on board were unharmed . On 14th May 2014 a KLM Boeing 737 - 700 en route from Manchester to Amsterdam Schiphol reported an electrical fault and fumes in the cockpit . The aircraft was diverted to Norwich Airport , where the 114 passengers landed without incident . On 20th March 2016 , a fire broke out in the roof of one of the Air Livery and KLM UK Engineering hangars , containing two aircraft - a Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 - full of fuel at 9 : 43am . The fire was out twelve hours later , with no one hurt due to the rapid response of the fire service . On 26th November 2016 , KLM Flight 1511 reported smoke in the cockpit and declared an emergency two minutes before landing from Amsterdam . The Fokker 70 landed safely with none of the 54 people on board hurt .

The first bus departs Norwich Airport at 06 : 35 and the last at 19 : 05 . Road ( edit ) Norwich Airport is situated adjacent to the A140 road , Cromer Road , which runs from Ipswich to Norwich and on to the seaside town of Cromer ; this also provides easy road access to Norwich city centre . The entrance to the airport is at the intersection of Amsterdam Way and Cromer Road . The Norwich Northern Distributor Road will link the airport to the A47 road , Great Yarmouth and Fakenham ( as well as Norwich itself ) , reducing the need to use the congested outer ring road and providing faster and better connections to other parts of the county and country . Part of this road will sever the end of the disused Runway 28 as it snakes its way up to the A1067 Fakenham Road . Rail ( edit ) Norwich Airport does not have a railway station ; the nearest is Norwich railway station approximately 4 miles ( 6.4 km ) away .

For other uses , see Hail Mary ( disambiguation ) . The Annunciation , by Fra Angelico The Hail Mary , also commonly called the Ave Maria ( Latin ) or Angelic Salutation , is a traditional Catholic prayer asking for the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary , the mother of Jesus . In Roman Catholicism , the prayer forms the basis of the Rosary and the Angelus prayers . In the Oriental Orthodox Churches , Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches , a similar prayer is used in formal liturgies , both in Greek and in translations . It is also used by many other groups within the catholic tradition of Christianity including Anglicans , Independent Catholics , and Old Catholics . Some Protestant denominations , such as Lutherans , also make use of a form of the prayer . Based on the greeting of the archangel Gabriel to the Virgin Mary in the Gospel of Luke , the prayer takes different forms in various traditions . It has often been set to music . Contents ( hide ) 1 Biblical source 2 In Western ( Latin ) tradition 3 Eastern Christian use 3.1 In Greek tradition 3.2 Slavonic versions 4 Roman Catholic use 5 Anglican use 6 Lutheran use 7 Musical settings 8 See also 9 References 10 External links Biblical source ( edit ) The prayer incorporates two passages from Saint Luke 's Gospel : `` Hail , the Lord is with thee . '' and `` Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb . '' In mid-13th - century Western Europe the prayer consisted only of these words with the single addition of the name `` Mary '' after the word `` Hail '' , as is evident from the commentary of Saint Thomas Aquinas on the prayer . The first of the two passages from Saint Luke 's Gospel is the greeting of the Angel Gabriel to Mary , originally written in Koine Greek . The opening word of greeting , χαῖρε , chaíre , here translated `` Hail '' , literally has the meaning `` rejoice '' or `` be glad '' . This was the normal greeting in the language in which Saint Luke 's Gospel is written and continues to be used in the same sense in Modern Greek . Accordingly , both `` Hail '' and `` Rejoice '' are valid English translations of the word ( `` Hail '' reflecting the Latin translation , and `` Rejoice '' reflecting the original Greek ) . The word κεχαριτωμένη , ( kecharitōménē ) , here translated as `` full of grace '' , admits of various translations . Grammatically , the word is the feminine perfect passive participle of the verb χαριτόω , charitóō , which means `` to show , or bestow with , grace '' and here , in the passive voice , `` to have grace shown , or bestowed upon , one '' . The text also appears in the account of the annunciation contained in the apocryphal Infancy Gospel of Matthew , in chapter 9 . The second passage is taken from Elizabeth 's greeting to Mary in Luke 1 : 42 , `` Blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb . '' Taken together , these two passages are the two times Mary is greeted in Chapter 1 of Luke . In Western ( Latin ) tradition ( edit ) Part of a series on the Mariology of the Catholic Church The Immaculate Conception , by Murillo Overview ( show ) Prayers Antiphons Hymns to Mary Devotional practices Prayers ( show ) Angelus Fátima Prayers Flos Carmeli Hail Mary Hail Mary of Gold Immaculata prayer Magnificat Mary , Mother of Grace Mary Our Queen Memorare Sub tuum praesidium Antiphons ( show ) Alma Redemptoris Mater Ave Maris Stella Ave Regina Caelorum Salve Regina Hymns to Mary ( show ) Hail Queen of Heaven , the Ocean Star Immaculate Mary Lo , How a Rose E'er Blooming O Sanctissima Regina Coeli Stabat Mater Devotional practices ( show ) Acts of Reparation Consecration to Mary First Saturdays Rosary Seven Joys of the Virgin Seven Sorrows of Mary Three Hail Marys Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary Catholicism portal After considering the use of similar words in Syriac , Greek and Latin in the 6th century , Herbert Thurston , writing in the Catholic Encyclopedia concludes that `` there is little or no trace of the Hail Mary as an accepted devotional formula before about 1050 '' , ( though a later pious tale attributed to Ildephonsus of Toledo ( fl . 7th century ) the use of the first part , namely the angel 's greeting Mary , without that of Elizabeth , as a prayer ) . All the evidence suggests that it took its rise from certain versicles and responsories occurring in the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary , which just at that time was coming into favour among the monastic orders . Saint Thomas Aquinas spoke of the name `` Mary '' as the only word added at his time to the Biblical text , to indicate the person who was `` full of grace . '' But at about the same time the name `` Jesus '' was also added , to specify who was meant by the phrase `` the fruit of thy womb . '' The Western version of the prayer is thus not derived from the Greek version : even the earliest Western forms have no trace of the Greek version 's phrases : `` Mother of God and Virgin '' and `` for thou hast given birth to the Saviour of our souls . '' To the greeting and praise of Mary of which the prayer thus consisted , a petition `` Holy Mary , Mother of God , pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death . Amen . '' was added later . The petition first appeared in print in 1495 in Girolamo Savonarola 's `` Esposizione sopra l'Ave Maria . '' The `` Hail Mary '' prayer in Savonarola 's exposition reads : `` Hail Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with thee ; blessed art thou amongst women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb , Jesus . Holy Mary , Mother of God , pray for us sinners , now and at the hour of our death . Amen '' The petition was commonly added around the time of the Council of Trent . The Dutch Jesuit St. Petrus Canisius is credited with adding in 1555 in his Catechism the sentence Holy Mary , Mother of God , pray for us sinners . Eleven years later , the sentence was included in the Catechism of the Council of Trent of 1566 . The `` Catechism of the Council of Trent '' says that to the first part of the Hail Mary , by which `` we render to God the highest praise and return Him most gracious thanks , because He has bestowed all His heavenly gifts on the most holy Virgin ... the Church of God has wisely added prayers and an invocation addressed to the most holy Mother of God ... we should earnestly implore her help and assistance ; for that she possesses exalted merits with God , and that she is most desirous to assist us by her prayers , no one can doubt without impiety and wickedness . '' The beginning of the verse in historiated letters in the book of hours Heures de Charles d'Angoulême The current Latin version is thus as follows , with accents added to indicate how the prayer is said in the current ecclesiastical pronunciation of Latin : Áve María , grátia pléna , Dóminus técum . Benedícta tū in muliéribus , et benedíctus frúctus véntris túi , Iésus . Sáncta María , Máter Déi , óra pro nóbis peccatóribus , nunc et in hóra mórtis nóstrae . Ámen . Hail Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with thee . Blessed art thou amongst women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb , Jesus . Holy Mary , Mother of God , pray for us sinners , now and at the hour of our death . Amen . On account of its connection with the Angelus , the Ave Maria was often inscribed on bells . Eastern christian use ( edit ) In Greek tradition ( edit ) The Hail Mary prayer of the Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches is in the form Θεοτόκε Παρθένε , χαῖρε , κεχαριτωμένη Μαρία , ὁ Κύριος μετὰ σοῦ . εὐλογημένη σὺ ἐν γυναιξί , καὶ εὐλογημένος ὁ καρπὸς τῆς κοιλίας σου , ὅτι Σωτῆρα ἔτεκες τῶν ψυχῶν ἡμῶν . God - bearing Virgin , rejoice , grace - filled Mary , the Lord with thee . Praised thou among women , and praised the fruit of thy womb , because it was the Saviour of our souls that thou borest . Another English rendering of the same text reads : Mother of God and Virgin , rejoice , Mary full of grace , the Lord is with thee . Blessed art thou amongst women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb , for thou hast given birth to the Saviour of our souls . To the Biblical texts this adds the opening invocation `` Theotokos Virgin , '' the name `` Mary '' and the concluding `` because it was the Saviour of our souls that thou bearest '' . In the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic churches , the prayer is very common in the Greek form indicated above , or in translations from it . Although it is not said quite as often as in the West , it is well known and often used and appears in several canons of prayer . It is typically sung thrice at the end of Vespers during an All - Night Vigil , as well as occurring many times in the course of daily prayer . Slavonic versions ( edit ) There exist two variant versions in Church Slavonic : Cyrillic Romanization English Translation Богородице дѣво радѹйсѧ ѡбрадованнаѧ Марїе Господь съ тобою благословена ты въ женахъ , и благословенъ плодъ чрева твоегѡ , Якѡ родила еси Христа Спаса , Избавителѧ дѹшамъ нашимъ . Bogoroditse Djevo , raduisya , Obradovannaya Marie , Gospodh s ' toboyu . Blagoslovena tyh v ' zhenach , Y blagosloven plod chreva Tvoego , Yako rodila esi Christa Spasa , Izbavitelya dusham nashim . Theotokos Virgin , rejoice , ( or : Rejoice , O Virgin Theotokos ) Mary full of grace , the Lord is with thee . Blessed art thou amongst women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb , for thou hast borne Christ the Saviour , the Deliverer of our souls . Богородице дѣво , радѹйсѧ , Благодатнаѧ Марїе , Господь съ тобою : благословена Ты въ женахъ , и благословенъ плодъ чрева Твоегѡ ; якѡ Спаса родила еси дѹшъ нашихъ . Bogoroditse Djevo , raduisya , Blagodatnaya Marie , Gospod s ' toboyu : Blagoslovyena tyh v ' zhenakh , Y blagoslovyen plod chreva Tvoyego , yako Spasa rodila yesi dush nashikh . Theotokos Virgin , rejoice , ( or : Rejoice , O Virgin Theotokos ) Mary full of grace , The Lord is with thee . Blessed art thou amongst women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb , for thou hast borne the Saviour of our souls . Church Slavonic Bogorodice děvo in traditional Cyrillic script The first is the older , and remains in use by the Old Believers as well as those who follow the Ruthenian recension ( among them the Ukrainian Greek - Catholic Church and the Ruthenian Catholic Church ) . The second , corresponding more closely to the Greek , appeared in 1656 under the liturgical reforms of Patriarch Nikon of Moscow , and is in use by the Russian Orthodox Church , the Serbian Orthodox Church , the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church ) . Roman Catholic use ( edit ) The Hail Mary is the central part of the Angelus , a devotion generally recited thrice daily by many Catholics , as well as broad & high church Anglicans , and Lutherans who usually omit the second half . The Hail Mary is the essential element of the Rosary , a prayer method in use especially among Roman Rite ( Western ) Catholics . The Eastern Catholic Churches say a similar version . The Rosary consists traditionally of three sets of five Mysteries , each mystery consisting of one `` decade '' or ten Ave Marias . The 150 Ave Marias of the Rosary thus echo the 150 psalms . These meditate upon events of Jesus ' life during his childhood ( Joyful Mysteries ) , Passion ( Sorrowful Mysteries ) , and from his Resurrection onwards ( Glorious Mysteries ) . Another set , the Luminous Mysteries , is of comparatively recent origin , having been proposed by Pope John Paul II in 2002 . Each of these Mysteries is prayed as a decade ( a unit of ten ) , consisting of one Our Father ( Pater Noster or The Lord 's Prayer ) , ten Hail Marys , and one ' Glory Be ' ( Gloria Patri ) ( Doxology ) . The restatement of the prayers locks one into fixed language , having the effect of freeing the conscious mind so that the recitation may come more from the heart and not the head . Pope Paul V said that `` the Rosary is a treasure of graces '' . Even for those souls who pray without meditating , the simple act of taking the beads in hand to pray is already a remembrance of God -- of the supernatural `` . Anglican use ( edit ) Anglicans also employ the Hail Mary in devotional practice . Traditional Anglicism uses the prayer in much the same way as Roman Catholics , including use of the Rosary and the recitation of the Angelus . Many Anglican churches contain statues of the Virgin Mary , and the faithful use devotional prayers including the Hail Mary . Lutheran use ( edit ) Martin Luther , the founder of Lutheranism , believed that Mary should be held in highest reverence . Although he did not agree with Mary 's veneration , he did advocate the use of the first half of the Hail Mary ( that is , `` Hail Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with thee . Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb , Jesus . '' ) as a sign of reverence for and devotion to the Virgin . Musical settings ( edit ) See also : Roman Catholic Marian music The Hail Mary , or Ave Maria in Latin , has been set to music numerous times . Arguably the two most famous settings are : the version by Franz Schubert ( 1825 ) ; originally composed as Ave Maria ( Ellens Gesang III , D839 , Op 52 no 6 , 1825 ) , Ellen 's third song in English , as part of his Opus 52 , a setting of seven songs from Walter Scott 's popular epic poem `` The Lady of the Lake '' , and was translated into German by Adam Storck , used in the final segment of Walt Disney 's Fantasia , opening with the greeting `` Ave Maria '' ( `` Hail Mary '' ) , but not a setting of the traditional Ave Maria prayer ; but nowadays commonly sung with the words of the traditional prayer . the version by Charles Gounod ( 1859 ) , adding melody and words to Johann Sebastian Bach 's first prelude from The Well - Tempered Clavier Anton Bruckner wrote three different settings , the best known being a motet for seven voices . Antonín Dvořák 's version was composed in 1877 . Another setting of Ave Maria was written by Giuseppe Verdi for his 1887 opera Otello . Russian composer César Cui , who was raised Roman Catholic , set the text at least three times : as the `` Ave Maria '' , op . 34 , for one or two women 's voices with piano or harmonium ( 1886 ) , and as part of two of his operas : Le flibustier ( premiered 1894 ) and Mateo Falcone ( 1907 ) . Settings also exist by Mozart , Liszt , Byrd , Elgar , Saint - Saëns , Rossini , Brahms , Stravinsky , Lauridsen , Franz Biebl , David Conte and Perosi as well as numerous versions by less well - known composers , such as J.B. Tresch and Ninel Samokhvalova . `` Ave Maria '' The prayer as a traditional Latin Gregorian chant `` Ave Maria '' The second of Anton Bruckner 's three settings of `` Ave Maria '' Problems playing these files ? See media help . In Slavonic , the text was also a popular subject for setting to music by Eastern European composers . These include Rachmaninov , Stravinsky , Bortniansky , Vavilov ( his version often misattributed to Caccini ) , Mikhail Shukh , Lyudmyla Hodzyumakha and others . This text was also very often set by composers in the Renaissance , including Josquin des Prez , Orlando di Lasso , and Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina . Before the Council of Trent there were actually different versions of the text , so the earlier composers in the period sometimes set versions of the text different from the ones shown above . Josquin des Prez , for example , himself set more than one version of the Ave Maria . Here is the text of his motet Ave Maria ... Virgo serena , which begins with the first six words above and continues with a poem in rhymed couplets .

Ave preclara omnibus angelicis virtutibus , cuius fuit assumptio nostra glorificatio . O Mater Dei , memento mei . Amen . The much anthologized Ave Maria by Jacques Arcadelt is actually a 19th - century arrangement by Pierre - Louis Dietsch , loosely based on Arcadelt 's three part madrigal Nous voyons que les hommes . Even though Protestant Christianity generally avoids any special veneration of Mary , access to the beautiful and culturally significant tradition of Marian music is facilitated by substitution texts . These texts are intended to replace the words of the standard `` Ave Maria '' , preserving word boundaries and syllable stresses , so that music written for the former text can be sung with the latter . An example is the Christ - centric Ave Redemptor : English translation Ave redemptor , Domine Iesus : Cuius ob opus Superatur mors , enim salvatio Nunc inundavit super universam terram . Sancte redemptor , reputata Fides est nobis peccatoribus , Nunc et in morte , ad iustitiam . Hail the Redeemer , Lord Jesus , By whose work Death is defeated , for salvation Has now overflowed upon all of the world . Holy redeemer , our faith Is reckoned to us sinners , Now and in death , as righteousness . A famous setting for the Orthodox version of the prayer in Church Slavonic ( Bogoroditsye Djevo ) was composed by Sergei Rachmaninoff in his All - Night Vigil .

            "Document Text: Hymn - wikipedia Hymn Jump to : navigation , search This article is about the type of song . For the character in Roman mythology , see Hymnus ( son of Entoria ) . For other uses , see Hymn ( disambiguation ) . A hymn is a type of song , usually religious , specifically written for the purpose of adoration or prayer , and typically addressed to a deity or deities , or to a prominent figure or personification . The word hymn derives from Greek ὕμνος ( hymnos ) , which means `` a song of praise '' . A writer of hymns is known as a hymnodist . The singing or composition of hymns is called hymnody . Collections of hymns are known as hymnals or hymn books . Hymns may or may not include instrumental accompaniment . Although most familiar to speakers of English in the context of Christianity , hymns are also a fixture of other world religions , especially on the Indian subcontinent . Hymns also survive from antiquity , especially from Egyptian and Greek cultures . Some of the oldest surviving examples of notated music are hymns with Greek texts .

The Western tradition of hymnody begins with the Homeric Hymns , a collection of ancient Greek hymns , the oldest of which were written in the 7th century BC , praising deities of the ancient Greek religions . Surviving from the 3rd century BC is a collection of six literary hymns ( Ὕμνοι ) by the Alexandrian poet Callimachus . Patristic writers began applying the term ὕμνος , or hymnus in Latin , to Christian songs of praise , and frequently used the word as a synonym for `` psalm '' . Christian hymnody ( edit ) Originally modeled on the Book of Psalms and other poetic passages ( commonly referred to as `` canticles '' ) in the Scriptures , Christian hymns are generally directed as praise to the Christian God . Many refer to Jesus Christ either directly or indirectly . Since the earliest times , Christians have sung `` psalms and hymns and spiritual songs '' , both in private devotions and in corporate worship ( Matthew 26 : 30 ; Mark 14 : 26 ; Acts 16 : 25 ; 1 Cor 14 : 26 ; Ephesians 5 : 19 ; Colossians 3 : 16 ; James 5 : 13 ; cf . Revelation 5 : 8 -- 10 ; Revelation 14 : 1 -- 5 ) . Non-scriptural hymns ( i.e. not psalms or canticles ) from the Early Church still sung today include ' Phos Hilaron ' , ' Sub tuum praesidium ' , and ' Te Deum ' . One definition of a hymn is `` ... a lyric poem , reverently and devotionally conceived , which is designed to be sung and which expresses the worshipper 's attitude toward God or God 's purposes in human life . It should be simple and metrical in form , genuinely emotional , poetic and literary in style , spiritual in quality , and in its ideas so direct and so immediately apparent as to unify a congregation while singing it . '' Christian hymns are often written with special or seasonal themes and these are used on holy days such as Christmas , Easter and the Feast of All Saints , or during particular seasons such as Advent and Lent . Others are used to encourage reverence for the Holy Bible or to celebrate Christian practices such as the eucharist or baptism . Some hymns praise or address individual saints , particularly the Blessed Virgin Mary ; such hymns are particularly prevalent in Catholicism , Eastern Orthodoxy and to some extent High Church Anglicanism . A writer of hymns is known as a hymnodist , and the practice of singing hymns is called hymnody ; the same word is used for the collectivity of hymns belonging to a particular denomination or period ( e.g. `` nineteenth century Methodist hymnody '' would mean the body of hymns written and / or used by Methodists in the 19th century ) . A collection of hymns is called a hymnal or hymnary . These may or may not include music . A student of hymnody is called a hymnologist , and the scholarly study of hymns , hymnists and hymnody is hymnology . The music to which a hymn may be sung is a hymn tune . In many Evangelical churches , traditional songs are classified as hymns while more contemporary worship songs are not considered hymns . The reason for this distinction is unclear , but according to some it is due to the radical shift of style and devotional thinking that began with the Jesus movement and Jesus music . Of note , in recent years , Christian traditional hymns have seen a revival in some churches , usually more Reformed or Calvinistic in nature , as modern hymn writers such as Keith and Kristyn Getty and Sovereign Grace Music have reset old lyrics to new melodies , revised old hymns and republished them , or simply written a song in accordance with Christian hymn standards such as the hymn , In Christ Alone . Music and accompaniment ( edit ) In ancient and medieval times , string instruments such as the harp , lyre and lute were used with psalms and hymns . Since there is a lack of musical notation in early writings , the actual musical forms in the early church can only be surmised . During the Middle Ages a rich hymnody developed in the form of Gregorian chant or plainsong . This type was sung in unison , in one of eight church modes , and most often by monastic choirs . While they were written originally in Latin , many have been translated ; a familiar example is the 4th century Of the Father 's Heart Begotten sung to the 11th century plainsong Divinum Mysterium . Western church ( edit ) Hymns are often accompanied by organ music Later hymnody in the Western church introduced four - part vocal harmony as the norm , adopting major and minor keys , and came to be led by organ and choir . It shares many elements with classical music . Today , except for choirs , more musically inclined congregations and a cappella congregations , hymns are typically sung in unison . In some cases complementary full settings for organ are also published , in others organists and other accompanists are expected to transcribe the four - part vocal score for their instrument of choice . To illustrate Protestant usage , in the traditional services and liturgies of the Methodist churches , which are based upon Anglican practice , hymns are sung ( often accompanied by an organ ) during the processional to the altar , during the receiving of communion , during the recessional , and sometimes at other points during the service . These hymns can be found in a common book such as the United Methodist Hymnal . The Doxology is also sung after the tithes and offerings are brought up to the altar . Contemporary Christian worship , as often found in Evangelicalism and Pentecostalism , may include the use of contemporary worship music played with electric guitars and the drum kit , sharing many elements with rock music . Other groups of Christians have historically excluded instrumental accompaniment , citing the absence of instruments in worship by the church in the first several centuries of its existence , and adhere to an unaccompanied a cappella congregational singing of hymns . These groups include the ' Brethren ' ( often both ' Open ' and ' Exclusive ' ) , the Churches of Christ , Mennonites , Primitive Baptists , and certain Reformed churches , although during the last century or so , several of these , such as the Free Church of Scotland have abandoned this stance . Eastern church ( edit ) Eastern Christianity ( the Eastern Orthodox , Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches ) have a very rich and ancient hymnographical tradition . Eastern chant is almost always a cappella , and instrumental accompaniment is rare . The central form of chant in the Eastern Orthodoxy is Byzantine Chant , which is used to chant all forms of liturgical worship . Exceptions include the Coptic Orthodox tradition which makes use of the cymbals and the Triangle ( musical instrument ) , the Indian Orthodox ( Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church ) which makes use of the organ and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church , which also uses drums , cymbals and other instruments on certain occasions . Development of Christian hymnody ( edit ) Thomas Aquinas , in the introduction to his commentary on the Psalms , defined the Christian hymn thus : `` Hymnus est laus Dei cum cantico ; canticum autem exultatio mentis de aeternis habita , prorumpens in vocem . '' ( `` A hymn is the praise of God with song ; a song is the exultation of the mind dwelling on eternal things , bursting forth in the voice . '' ) The Protestant Reformation resulted in two conflicting attitudes towards hymns . One approach , the regulative principle of worship , favoured by many Zwinglians , Calvinists and some radical reformers , considered anything that was not directly authorised by the Bible to be a novel and Catholic introduction to worship , which was to be rejected . All hymns that were not direct quotations from the Bible fell into this category . Such hymns were banned , along with any form of instrumental musical accompaniment , and organs were removed from churches . Instead of hymns , biblical psalms were chanted , most often without accompaniment , to very basic melodies . This was known as exclusive psalmody . Examples of this may still be found in various places , including in some of the Presbyterian churches of western Scotland . Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott Luther 's paraphrase of Psalm 46 is a popular Lutheran hymn Problems playing this file ? See media help . The other Reformation approach , the normative principle of worship , produced a burst of hymn writing and congregational singing . Martin Luther is notable not only as a reformer , but as the author of many hymns including `` Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott '' ( `` A Mighty Fortress Is Our God '' ) , which is sung today even by Catholics , and `` Gelobet seist du , Jesu Christ '' ( `` Praise be to You , Jesus Christ '' ) for Christmas . Luther and his followers often used their hymns , or chorales , to teach tenets of the faith to worshipers . The first Protestant hymnal was published in Bohemia in 1532 by the Unitas Fratrum . Count Zinzendorf , the Lutheran leader of the Moravian Church in the 18th century wrote some 2,000 hymns . The earlier English writers tended to paraphrase biblical texts , particularly Psalms ; Isaac Watts followed this tradition , but is also credited as having written the first English hymn which was not a direct paraphrase of Scripture . Watts ( 1674 -- 1748 ) , whose father was an Elder of a dissenter congregation , complained at age 16 , that when allowed only psalms to sing , the faithful could not even sing about their Lord , Christ Jesus . His father invited him to see what he could do about it ; the result was Watts ' first hymn , `` Behold the glories of the Lamb '' . Found in few hymnals today , the hymn has eight stanzas in common meter and is based on Revelation 5 : 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 . Relying heavily on Scripture , Watts wrote metered texts based on New Testament passages that brought the Christian faith into the songs of the church . Isaac Watts has been called `` the father of English hymnody '' , but Erik Routley sees him more as `` the liberator of English hymnody '' , because his hymns , and hymns like them , moved worshipers beyond singing only Old Testament psalms , inspiring congregations and revitalizing worship . Later writers took even more freedom , some even including allegory and metaphor in their texts . Charles Wesley 's hymns spread Methodist theology , not only within Methodism , but in most Protestant churches . He developed a new focus : expressing one 's personal feelings in the relationship with God as well as the simple worship seen in older hymns . Wesley wrote : Where shall my wondering soul begin ? How shall I all to heaven aspire ? A slave redeemed from death and sin , A brand plucked from eternal fire , How shall I equal triumphs raise , Or sing my great deliverer 's praise . Battle Hymn of the Republic The Battle Hymn of the Republic , performed by Frank C. Stanley , Elise Stevenson , and a mixed quartet in 1908 . Problems playing this file ? See media help . Wesley 's contribution , along with the Second Great Awakening in America led to a new style called gospel , and a new explosion of sacred music writing with Fanny Crosby , Lina Sandell , Philip Bliss , Ira D. Sankey , and others who produced testimonial music for revivals , camp meetings , and evangelistic crusades . The tune style or form is technically designated `` gospel songs '' as distinct from hymns . Gospel songs generally include a refrain ( or chorus ) and usually ( though not always ) a faster tempo than the hymns . As examples of the distinction , `` Amazing Grace '' is a hymn ( no refrain ) , but `` How Great Thou Art '' is a gospel song . During the 19th century , the gospel - song genre spread rapidly in Protestantism and to a lesser but still definite extent , in Roman Catholicism ; the gospel - song genre is unknown in the worship per se by Eastern Orthodox churches , which rely exclusively on traditional chants ( a type of hymn ) . The Methodist Revival of the 18th century created an explosion of hymn - writing in Welsh , which continued into the first half of the 19th century . The most prominent names among Welsh hymn - writers are William Williams Pantycelyn and Ann Griffiths . The second half of the 19th century witnessed an explosion of hymn tune composition and choir singing in Wales . Along with the more classical sacred music of composers ranging from Mozart to Monteverdi , the Catholic Church continued to produce many popular hymns such as Lead , Kindly Light , Silent Night , O Sacrament Divine and Faith of our Fathers . Many churches today use contemporary worship music which includes a range of styles often influenced by popular music . This often leads to some conflict between older and younger congregants ( see contemporary worship ) . This is not new ; the Christian pop music style began in the late 1960s and became very popular during the 1970s , as young hymnists sought ways in which to make the music of their religion relevant for their generation . This long tradition has resulted in a wide variety of hymns . Some modern churches include within hymnody the traditional hymn ( usually describing God ) , contemporary worship music ( often directed to God ) and gospel music ( expressions of one 's personal experience of God ) . This distinction is not perfectly clear ; and purists remove the second two types from the classification as hymns . It is a matter of debate , even sometimes within a single congregation , often between revivalist and traditionalist movements . American developments ( edit ) African - Americans developed a rich hymnody from spirituals during times of slavery to the modern , lively black gospel style . The first influences of African American Culture into hymns came from Slave Songs of the United States a collection of slave hymns compiled by William Francis Allen who had difficulty pinning them down from the oral tradition , and though he succeeded , he points out the awe inspiring effect of the hymns when sung in by their originators . Hymn writing , composition , performance and the publishing of Christian hymnals were prolific in the 19th - century and were often linked to the abolitionist movement by many hymn writers . Surprisingly , Stephen Foster wrote a number of hymns that were used during church services during this era of publishing . Thomas Symmes spread throughout churches a new idea of how to sing hymns , in which anyone could sing a hymn any way they felt led to ; this idea was opposed by the views of Symmes ' colleagues who felt it was `` like Five Hundred different Tunes roared out at the same time '' . William Billings , a singing school teacher , created the first tune book with only American born compositions . Within his books , Billings did not put as much emphasis on `` common measure '' which was the typical way hymns were sung , but he attempted `` to have a Sufficiency in each measure '' . Boston 's Handel and Haydn Society aimed at raising the level of church music in America , publishing their `` Collection of Church Music '' . In the late 19th century Ira D. Sankey and Dwight L. Moody developed the relatively new subcategory of gospel hymns . Earlier in the 19th century , the use of musical notation , especially shape notes , exploded in America , and professional singing masters went from town to town teaching the population how to sing from sight , instead of the more common lining out that had been used before that . During this period hundreds of tune books were published , including B.F. White 's Sacred Harp , and earlier works like the Missouri Harmony , Kentucky Harmony , Hesperian Harp , D.H. Mansfield 's The American Vocalist , The Social Harp , the Southern Harmony , William Walker 's Christian Harmony , Jeremiah Ingalls ' Christian Harmony , and literally many dozens of others . Shape notes were important in the spread of ( then ) more modern singing styles , with tenor - led 4 - part harmony ( based on older English West Gallery music ) , fuging sections , anthems and other more complex features . During this period , hymns were incredibly popular in the United States , and one or more of the above - mentioned tunebooks could be found in almost every household . It is n't uncommon to hear accounts of young people and teenagers gathering together to spend an afternoon singing hymns and anthems from tune books , which was considered great fun , and there are surviving accounts of Abraham Lincoln and his sweetheart singing together from the Missouri Harmony during his youth . By the 1860s musical reformers like Lowell Mason ( the so - called `` better music boys '' ) were actively campaigning for the introduction of more `` refined '' and modern singing styles , and eventually these American tune books were replaced in many churches , starting in the Northeast and urban areas , and spreading out into the countryside as people adopted the gentler , more soothing tones of Victorian hymnody , and even adopted dedicated , trained choirs to do their church 's singing , rather than having the entire congregation participate . But in many rural areas the old traditions lived on , not in churches , but in weekly , monthly or annual conventions were people would meet to sing from their favorite tunebooks . The most popular one , and the only one that survived continuously in print , was the Sacred Harp , which could be found in the typical rural Southern home right up until the living tradition was `` re-discovered '' by Alan Lomax in the 1960s ( although it had been well - documented by musicologist George Pullen Jackson prior to this ) . Indeed , `` the most common book on . Since then there has been a renaissance in `` Sacred Harp singing '' , with annual conventions popping up in all 50 states and in a number of European countries recently , including the UK , Germany , Ireland and Poland , as well as in Australia. ( 1 ) Today `` Sacred Harp singing '' is a vibrant and living tradition with thousands of enthusiastic participants all around the globe , drawn to the democratic principles of the tradition and exotic , beautiful sound of the music . Although the lyrics tend to be highly religious in nature , the tradition is largely secular , and participation if open to all who care to attend . Hymn meters ( edit ) Main article : Meter ( hymn ) The meter indicates the number of syllables for the lines in each stanza of a hymn . This provides a means of marrying the hymn 's text with an appropriate hymn tune for singing . In practice many hymns conform to one of a relatively small number of meters ( syllable count and stress patterns ) . Care must be taken , however , to ensure that not only the metre of words and tune match , but also the stresses on the words in each line . Technically speaking an iambic tune , for instance , can not be used with words of , say , trochaic metre . The meter is often denoted by a row of figures besides the name of the tune , such as `` 87.87. 87 '' , which would inform the reader that each verse has six lines , and that the first line has eight syllables , the second has seven , the third line eight , etc . The meter can also be described by initials ; L.M. indicates long meter , which is 88.88 ( four lines , each eight syllables long ) ; S.M. is short meter ( 66.86 ) ; C.M. is common metre ( 86.86 ) , while D.L.M. , D.S.M. and D.C.M. ( the `` D '' stands for double ) are similar to their respective single meters except that they have eight lines in a verse instead of four . Also , if the number of syllables in one verse differ from another verse in the same hymn ( e.g. , the hymn `` I Sing a Song of the Saints of God '' ) , the meter is called Irregular . Sikh hymnody ( edit ) The Sikh holy book , the Guru Granth Sahib Ji ( Punjabi : ਗੁਰੂ ਗ੍ਰੰਥ ਸਾਹਿਬ Punjabi pronunciation : ( ɡʊɾu ɡɾənth sɑhɪb ) ) , is a collection of hymns ( Shabad ) or Gurbani describing the qualities of God and why one should meditate on God 's name . The Guru Granth Sahib is divided by their musical setting in different ragas into fourteen hundred and thirty pages known as Angs ( limbs ) in Sikh tradition . Guru Gobind Singh ( 1666 -- 1708 ) , the tenth guru , after adding Guru Tegh Bahadur 's bani to the Adi Granth affirmed the sacred text as his successor , elevating it to Guru Granth Sahib . The text remains the holy scripture of the Sikhs , regarded as the teachings of the Ten Gurus . The role of Guru Granth Sahib , as a source or guide of prayer , is pivotal in Sikh worship .

            "Document Text: She 'll be Coming ' Round the Mountain - wikipedia She 'll be Coming ' Round the Mountain Jump to : navigation , search `` She 'll Be Coming ' Round the Mountain '' ( also sometimes called simply `` Coming ' Round the Mountain '' ) is a traditional folk song often categorized as children 's music . The song is derived from a Christian song known as `` When the Chariot Comes '' . The song 's style is reminiscent of the call and response structure of many folk songs ; among them are songs with a similar verse - structure but variant melodies , such as If You 're Happy and You Know It . These kinds of songs can be traced back to 17th - century British radical protestants and later commonly appeared in ballads as well as some religious songs : examples include `` What Wondrous Love Is This '' , `` Brave Benbow '' , `` The Ballad of Captain Kidd '' , `` Sam Hall '' and `` Ye Jacobites by Name '' . Contents ( hide ) 1 Old spiritual 2 Children 's song 3 Variations 4 References 5 Further reading Old spiritual ( edit ) Although the first printed version of the song appeared in Carl Sandburg 's The American Songbag in 1927 , it is believed to have originated during the late 1800s , based on an old spiritual titled `` When the Chariot Comes '' sung to the same melody , which during the 19th century spread through Appalachia , where the lyrics were changed into their current form , which is often heard today with responses that add on to the previous verse . The song ostensibly refers to the Second Coming of Christ and subsequent Rapture , with the she referring to the chariot that the returning Christ is imagined as driving . Like most spirituals originating in the African - American community , however , this was probably a coded anthem for the Underground Railroad . Children 's song ( edit ) The secularized version was sung by railroad work gangs in the Midwestern United States in the 1890s . Currently the song is usually sung in collections of children 's music . The song has been recorded by musicians ranging from Tommy Tucker Time ( 78'inch ) to Pete Seeger or Barney the Dinosaur . Harking back to the original lyrics of `` When the Chariot Comes '' , the song is sometimes referenced in relation to the end of the world , most notably in The Illuminatus ! Trilogy and the comic book Promethea . Variations ( edit ) The Danish song `` Du må få min sofacykel '' has the same melody , but the lyrics of the song are about someone giving away their `` sofa bike '' , a bike with a back rest . The original of this song was a drinking song written by the Danish poet , songwriter and artist Mogens Lorentzen around the beginning of the 20th century . A Famous Studios Screen Song , `` Comin ' Round the Mountain '' was released based on this song , and is the featured sing - along song of the cartoon . Alvin and the Chipmunks covered the song for their 1960 album Sing Again with The Chipmunks . The 1962 Folkways Records album of anti-Polaris songs , Ding Dong Dollar , uses the tune for the eponymous opening track . In 1967 Bob Dylan and The Band recorded the song , released on their album The Bootleg Series Vol. 11 : The Basement Tapes Complete . A funk version of the song appears on the 1976 album Hardcore Jollies from Funkadelic . The Peanuts cast performed the song in the 1977 film Race for Your Life , Charlie Brown . It was performed by The Winans in This is America , Charlie Brown in its episode `` Building of the Transcontinental Railroad '' . In Scotland , there is a variant to the song called ' Ye Cannae Shove Yer Granny Aff a Bus ' , written by The Singing Kettle . Raffi changed the song 's lyrics to `` He 'll be Comin ' Down the Chimney '' ( a reference to Santa Claus ) on his 1977 album More Singable Songs . He also included an instrumental polka rendition of the song entitled `` Mountain Polka '' on his Everything Grows album . A song titled `` Supergrass '' ( and a number of variant titles ) is attested with a similar tune , though it has a lyrical structure with verses and a chorus . The song is a political satire on the Troubles ; its narrator is a cowardly informant who is fleeing from the men he allegedly betrayed . It has been recorded by bands including The Irish Brigade and Athenrye . In the Reader 's Digest Children 's Songbook published in 1985 , the song is adapted with new words by Dan Fox and his son Paul and tells of the things that `` she '' will do in increasing number up to ten ( e.g. : `` She 'll be ridin ' on a camel , '' `` She 'll be tuggin ' on two turtles , '' `` She 'll be carvin ' three thick thistles , '' `` She 'll be pluckin ' four fat pheasants , '' etc . ) . The American death metal band Macabre used the melody on the song `` Coming to Chicago '' on their 2000 album Dahmer themed on the life of Jeffrey Dahmer . Ned Flanders of The Simpsons sang his own variation in `` The Bart of War '' which declares that `` poison gas injectors '' could threaten his safety . Jibjab created a satire about George W. Bush 's re-election called `` Second Term '' to the tune of `` She 'll Be Coming ' Round the Mountain '' . In Wizards of Waverly Place episode `` Monster Hunter '' first broadcast in 2009 , Harper Finkle creates a `` spell song '' for Alex Russo to remember the spells . In 2012 Neil Young together with Crazy Horse recorded an almost six minutes long version on their album Americana with the title `` Jesus Chariot '' . At least two soccer chants are sung to the tune of this song : English fans chant `` Ten German Bombers '' when their team is playing Germany . And Newcastle United fans chant `` Ten Mackem Bastards '' -- celebrating Shola Ameobi 's excellent record against their local rivals Sunderland . The German song `` Von den blauen Bergen kommen wir '' shares the same melody , as does the song `` Tante aus Marokko '' and its Dutch equivalent , `` Tante uit Marokko '' . These last two songs use similar themes from the original but personify the main character more literally as a cowgirl from the Wild West . A similar song is found in Norway ( derived from Lorentzen 's Danish version ) : `` Du skal få min gamle sykkel når jeg dør ( hvis jeg dør ) . '' The verses list all the `` old '' ( gamle ) things that `` you '' ( du ) can have `` when / if I die '' ( når / hvis jeg dør ) . The things on offer range from the lightly humorous to the scatological and pornographic , with many also playing on religion ( `` you can have my old bike / when I die , / ' cause the last onehundred meters / I can hitch - hike with St. Peter '' ) . For a good selection of verses , click here . Back in the 1960 's , the Norwegian children 's songwriter Thorbjørn Egner wrote a completely different text to the same melody instructing children about how to move safely in urban traffic ( `` Trafikkvisa '' ) . A similar song is known also in Finland , sometimes titled as Perintölaulu ( Heritage Song ) : `` Kun mä kuolen , X : ni sä saat . '' ( When I die , you will get my X . ) As a drinking song , some newer verses are rather tasteless . The Malaysian Scout song , `` Lai Chi Kan '' , uses the tune . The Italian Boy Scouts used to sing the song with very approximate English lyrics or unrelated Italian ones up until the ' Eighties . It was called `` Singhingaia '' from the refrain . Some sports fans at the University of Cambridge use this tune to sing `` we would rather be at Oxford than St John 's '' .

            "Document Text: Jehovah - wikipedia Jehovah Jump to : navigation , search This article is about the word Jehovah . For the deity , see God in Abrahamic religions . For other uses , see Jehovah ( disambiguation ) . `` Jehovah '' at Exodus 6 : 3 ( 1611 King James Version ) Jehovah ( / dʒ ɪˈhoʊvə / ji - HOH - və ) is a Latinization of the Hebrew יְהֹוָה ‬ , one vocalization of the Tetragrammaton יהוה ‬ ( YHWH ) , the proper name of the God of Israel in the Hebrew Bible and one of the seven names of God in Judaism . The consensus among scholars is that the historical vocalization of the Tetragrammaton at the time of the redaction of the Torah ( 6th century BCE ) is most likely Yahweh . The historical vocalization was lost because in Second Temple Judaism , during the 3rd to 2nd centuries BCE , the pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton came to be avoided , being substituted with Adonai ( `` my Lord '' ) . The Hebrew vowel points of Adonai were added to the Tetragrammaton by the Masoretes , and the resulting form was transliterated around the 12th century as Yehowah . The derived forms Iehouah and Jehovah first appeared in the 16th century . `` Jehovah '' was popularized in the English - speaking world by William Tyndale and other pioneer English Protestant translations such as the Geneva Bible and the King James Version . It is still used in some translations , such as the New World Translation , the American Standard Version , and Young 's Literal Translation , but it does not appear in most mainstream English translations , as the terms `` Lord '' or `` LORD '' : used instead , generally indicating that the corresponding Hebrew is Yahweh or YHWH .

Most scholars believe `` Jehovah '' ( also transliterated as `` Yehowah '' ) to be a hybrid form derived by combining the Latin letters JHVH with the vowels of Adonai . Some hold that there is evidence that a form of the Tetragrammaton similar to Jehovah may have been in use in Semitic and Greek phonetic texts and artifacts from Late Antiquity . Others say that it is the pronunciation Yahweh that is testified in both Christian and pagan texts of the early Christian era . Karaite Jews , as proponents of the rendering Jehovah , state that although the original pronunciation of יהוה has been obscured by disuse of the spoken name according to oral Rabbinic law , well - established English transliterations of other Hebrew personal names are accepted in normal usage , such as Joshua , Jeremiah , Isaiah or Jesus , for which the original pronunciations may be unknown . They also point out that `` the English form Jehovah is quite simply an Anglicized form of Y hovah , '' and preserves the four Hebrew consonants `` YHVH '' ( with the introduction of the `` J '' sound in English ) . Some argue that Jehovah is preferable to Yahweh , based on their conclusion that the Tetragrammaton was likely tri-syllabic originally , and that modern forms should therefore also have three syllables . Biblical scholar Francis B. Dennio , in an article he wrote , in the Journal of Biblical Literature , said : `` Jehovah misrepresents Yahweh no more than Jeremiah misrepresents Yirmeyahu . The settled connotations of Isaiah and Jeremiah forbid questioning their right . '' Dennio argued that the form `` Jehovah '' is not a barbarism , but is the best English form available , being that it has for centuries gathered the necessary connotations and associations for valid use in English . According to a Jewish tradition developed during the 3rd to 2nd centuries BCE , the Tetragrammaton is written but not pronounced . When read , substitute terms replace the divine name where יְהֹוָה ‬ appears in the text . It is widely assumed , as proposed by the 19th - century Hebrew scholar Gesenius , that the vowels of the substitutes of the name -- Adonai ( Lord ) and Elohim ( God ) -- were inserted by the Masoretes to indicate that these substitutes were to be used . When יהוה precedes or follows Adonai , the Masoretes placed the vowel points of Elohim into the Tetragrammaton , producing a different vocalization of the Tetragrammaton יֱהֹוִה ‬ , which was read as Elohim . Based on this reasoning , the form יְהֹוָה ‬ ( Jehovah ) has been characterized by some as a `` hybrid form '' , and even `` a philological impossibility '' . Early modern translators disregarded the practice of reading Adonai ( or its equivalents in Greek and Latin , Κύριος and Dominus ) in place of the Tetragrammaton and instead combined the four Hebrew letters of the Tetragrammaton with the vowel points that , except in synagogue scrolls , accompanied them , resulting in the form Jehovah . This form , which first took effect in works dated 1278 and 1303 , was adopted in Tyndale 's and some other Protestant translations of the Bible . In the 1560 Geneva Bible , the Tetragrammaton is translated as Jehovah six times , four as the proper name , and two as place - names . In the 1611 King James Version , Jehovah occurred seven times . In the 1885 English Revised Version , the form Jehovah occurs twelve times . In the 1901 American Standard Version the form `` Je - ho'vah '' became the regular English rendering of the Hebrew יהוה , all throughout , in preference to the previously dominant `` the LORD '' , which is generally used in the King James Version . It is also used in Christian hymns such as the 1771 hymn , `` Guide Me , O Thou Great Jehovah '' . Development The most widespread theory is that the Hebrew term יְהֹוָה ‬ has the vowel points of אֲדֹנָי ‬ ( adonai ) . Using the vowels of adonai , the composite hataf patah ֲ ‬ under the guttural alef א becomes a sheva ְ ‬ under the yod י , the holam ֹ ‬ is placed over the first he ה , and the qamats ָ ‬ is placed under the vav ו , giving יְהֹוָה ‬ ( Jehovah ) . When the two names , יהוה and אדני , occur together , the former is pointed with a hataf segol ֱ ‬ under the yod י and a hiriq ִ ‬ under the second he ה , giving יֱהֹוִה ‬ , to indicate that it is to be read as ( elohim ) in order to avoid adonai being repeated . Taking the spellings at face value may have been as a result of not knowing about the Q 're perpetuum , resulting in the transliteration Yehowah and derived variants . Emil G. Hirsch was among the modern scholars that recognized `` Jehovah '' to be `` grammatically impossible '' . A 1552 Latin translation of the Sefer Yetzirah , using the form Iehouah for the `` magnum Nomen tetragrammatum '' . יְהֹוָה ‬ appears 6,518 times in the traditional Masoretic Text , in addition to 305 instances of יֱהֹוִה ‬ ( Jehovih ) . The pronunciation Jehovah is believed to have arisen through the introduction of vowels of the qere -- the marginal notation used by the Masoretes . In places where the consonants of the text to be read ( the qere ) differed from the consonants of the written text ( the kethib ) , they wrote the qere in the margin to indicate that the kethib was read using the vowels of the qere . For a few very frequent words the marginal note was omitted , referred to as q 're perpetuum . One of these frequent cases was God 's name , which was not to be pronounced in fear of profaning the `` ineffable name '' . Instead , wherever יהוה ( YHWH ) appears in the kethib of the biblical and liturgical books , it was to be read as אֲדֹנָי ‬ ( adonai , `` My Lord ( plural of majesty ) '' ) , or as אֱלֹהִים ‬ ( elohim , `` God '' ) if adonai appears next to it . This combination produces יְהֹוָה ‬ ( yehovah ) and יֱהֹוִה ‬ ( yehovih ) respectively . יהוה is also written ' ה , or even ' ד , and read ha - Shem ( `` the name '' ) . Scholars are not in total agreement as to why יְהֹוָה ‬ does not have precisely the same vowel points as adonai . The use of the composite hataf segol ֱ ‬ in cases where the name is to be read , `` elohim '' , has led to the opinion that the composite hataf patah ֲ ‬ ought to have been used to indicate the reading , `` adonai '' . It has been argued conversely that the disuse of the patah is consistent with the Babylonian system , in which the composite is uncommon . Vowel points of יְהֹוָה ‬ and אֲדֹנָי ‬ The spelling of the Tetragrammaton and connected forms in the Hebrew Masoretic text of the Bible , with vowel points shown in red . The table below shows the vowel points of Yehovah and Adonay , indicating the simple sheva in Yehovah in contrast to the hataf patah in Adonay . As indicated to the right , the vowel points used when YHWH is intended to be pronounced as Adonai are slightly different to those used in Adonai itself . Hebrew ( Strong 's # 3068 ) YEHOVAH יְהֹוָה ‬ Hebrew ( Strong 's # 136 ) ADONAY אֲדֹנָי ‬ י Yod Y א Aleph glottal stop ְ ‬ Simple sheva ֲ ‬ Hataf patah ה He ד Dalet ֹ ‬ Holam O ֹ ‬ Holam O ו Vav V נ Nun ָ ‬ Qamats ָ ‬ Qamats ה He י Yod Y The difference between the vowel points of ' ǎdônây and YHWH is explained by the rules of Hebrew morphology and phonetics . Sheva and hataf - patah were allophones of the same phoneme used in different situations : hataf - patah on glottal consonants including aleph ( such as the first letter in Adonai ) , and simple sheva on other consonants ( such as the Y in YHWH ) . Introduction into English The `` peculiar , special , honorable and most blessed name of God '' Iehoua , an older English form of Jehovah ( Roger Hutchinson , The image of God , 1550 ) The earliest available Latin text to use a vocalization similar to Jehovah dates from the 13th century . The Brown - Driver - Briggs Lexicon suggested that the pronunciation Jehovah was unknown until 1520 when it was introduced by Galatinus , who defended its use . In English it appeared in William Tyndale 's translation of the Pentateuch ( `` The Five Books of Moses '' ) published in 1530 in Germany , where Tyndale had studied since 1524 , possibly in one or more of the universities at Wittenberg , Worms and Marburg , where Hebrew was taught . The spelling used by Tyndale was `` Iehouah '' ; at that time , `` I '' was not distinguished from J , and U was not distinguished from V . The original 1611 printing of the Authorized King James Version used `` Iehovah '' . Tyndale wrote about the divine name : `` IEHOUAH ( Jehovah ) , is God 's name ; neither is any creature so called ; and it is as much to say as , One that is of himself , and dependeth of nothing . Moreover , as oft as thou seest LORD in great letters ( except there be any error in the printing ) , it is in Hebrew Iehouah , Thou that art ; or , He that is . '' The name is also found in a 1651 edition of Ramón Martí 's Pugio fidei . The name Jehovah appeared in all early Protestant Bibles in English , except Coverdale 's translation in 1535 . The Roman Catholic Douay - Rheims Bible used `` the Lord '' , corresponding to the Latin Vulgate 's use of `` Dominus '' ( Latin for `` Adonai '' , `` Lord '' ) to represent the Tetragrammaton . The Authorized King James Version , which used `` Jehovah '' in a few places , most frequently gave `` the LORD '' as the equivalent of the Tetragrammaton . The name Jehovah appeared in John Rogers ' Matthew Bible in 1537 , the Great Bible of 1539 , the Geneva Bible of 1560 , Bishop 's Bible of 1568 and the King James Version of 1611 . More recently , it has been used in the Revised Version of 1885 , the American Standard Version in 1901 , and the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures of Jehovah 's Witnesses in 1961 . At Exodus 6 : 3 -- 6 , where the King James Version has Jehovah , the Revised Standard Version ( 1952 ) , the New American Standard Bible ( 1971 ) , the New International Version ( 1978 ) , the New King James Version ( 1982 ) , the New Revised Standard Version ( 1989 ) , the New Century Version ( 1991 ) , and the Contemporary English Version ( 1995 ) give `` LORD '' or `` Lord '' as their rendering of the Tetragrammaton , while the New Jerusalem Bible ( 1985 ) , the Amplified Bible ( 1987 ) , the New Living Translation ( 1996 , revised 2007 ) , the English Standard Version ( 2001 ) , and the Holman Christian Standard Bible ( 2004 ) use the form Yahweh . Hebrew vowel points Modern guides to biblical Hebrew grammar , such as Duane A Garrett 's A Modern Grammar for Classical Hebrew state that the Hebrew vowel points now found in printed Hebrew Bibles were invented in the second half of the first millennium AD , long after the texts were written . This is indicated in the authoritative Hebrew Grammar of Gesenius , `` Jehovist '' scholars , largely earlier than the 20th century , who believe / dʒ əˈhoʊvə / to be the original pronunciation of the divine name , argue that the Hebraic vowel - points and accents were known to writers of the scriptures in antiquity and that both Scripture and history argue in favor of their ab origine status to the Hebrew language . Some members of Karaite Judaism , such as Nehemia Gordon , hold this view . The antiquity of the vowel points and of the rendering Jehovah was defended by various scholars , including Michaelis , Drach , Stier , William Fulke ( 1583 ) , Johannes Buxtorf , his son Johannes Buxtorf II , and John Owen ( 17th century ) ; Peter Whitfield and John Gill ( 18th century ) , John Moncrieff ( 19th century ) , Johann Friedrich von Meyer ( 1832 ) Thomas D. Ross has given an account of the controversy on this matter in England down to 1833 . G.A. Riplinger , John Hinton , Thomas M. Strouse , are more recent defenders of the authenticity of the vowel points . Jehovist writers such as Nehemia Gordon , who helped make a translation of the `` Dead Sea Scrolls '' , have acknowledged the general agreement among scholars that the original pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton was probably Yahweh , and that the vowel points now attached to the Tetragrammaton were added to indicate that Adonai was to be read instead , as seen in the alteration of those points after prefixes . He wrote : `` There is a virtual scholarly consensus concerning this name '' and `` this is presented as fact in every introduction to Biblical Hebrew and every scholarly discussion of the name . '' Gordon , disputing this consensus , wrote , `` However , this consensus is not based on decisive proof . We have seen that the scholarly consensus concerning Yahweh is really just a wild guess , '' and went on to say that the vowel points of Adonai are not correct . He argued that `` the name is really pronounced Ye - ho - vah with the emphasis on ' vah ' . Pronouncing the name Yehovah with the emphasis on ' ho ' ( as in English Jehovah ) would quite simply be a mistake . '' Proponents of pre-christian origin 18th - century theologian John Gill puts forward the arguments of 17th - century Johannes Buxtorf II and others in his writing , A Dissertation Concerning the Antiquity of the Hebrew Language , Letters , Vowel - Points and Accents . He argued for an extreme antiquity of their use , rejecting the idea that the vowel points were invented by the Masoretes . Gill presented writings , including passages of scripture , that he interpreted as supportive of his `` Jehovist '' viewpoint that the Old Testament must have included vowel - points and accents . He claimed that the use of Hebrew vowel points of יְהֹוָה ‬ , and therefore of the name Jehovah / jəˈhoʊvə / , is documented from before 200 BCE , and even back to Adam , citing Jewish tradition that Hebrew was the first language . He argued that throughout this history the Masoretes did not invent the vowel points and accents , but that they were delivered to Moses by God at Sinai , citing Karaite authorities Mordechai ben Nisan Kukizov ( 1699 ) and his associates , who stated that `` all our wise men with one mouth affirm and profess that the whole law was pointed and accented , as it came out of the hands of Moses , the man of God . '' The argument between Karaite and Rabbinic Judaism on whether it was lawful to pronounce the name represented by the Tetragrammaton is claimed to show that some copies have always been pointed ( voweled ) and that some copies were not pointed with the vowels because of `` oral law '' , for control of interpretation by some Judeo sects , including non-pointed copies in synagogues . Gill claimed that the pronunciation / jəˈhoʊvə / can be traced back to early historical sources which indicate that vowel points and / or accents were used in their time . Sources Gill claimed supported his view include : The Book of Cosri and commentator Rabbi Judab Muscatus , which claim that the vowel points were taught to Adam by God . Saadiah Gaon ( 927 AD ) Jerome ( 380 AD ) Origen ( 250 AD ) The Zohar ( 120 AD ) Jesus Christ ( 31 AD ) , based on Gill 's interpretation of Matthew 5 : 18 Hillel the Elder and Shammai division ( 30 BC ) Karaites ( 120 BCE ) Demetrius Phalereus , librarian for Ptolemy II Philadelphus king of Egypt ( 277 BCE ) Gill quoted Elia Levita , who said , `` There is no syllable without a point , and there is no word without an accent , '' as showing that the vowel points and the accents found in printed Hebrew Bibles have a dependence on each other , and so Gill attributed the same antiquity to the accents as to the vowel points . Gill acknowledged that Levita , `` first asserted the vowel points were invented by `` the men of Tiberias '' , but made reference to his condition that `` if anyone could convince him that his opinion was contrary to the book of Zohar , he should be content to have it rejected . '' Gill then alludes to the book of Zohar , stating that rabbis declared it older than the Masoretes , and that it attests to the vowel - points and accents . William Fulke , John Gill , John Owen , and others held that Jesus Christ referred to a Hebrew vowel point or accent at Matthew 5 : 18 , indicated in the King James Version by the word tittle . The 1602 Spanish Bible ( Reina - Valera / Cipriano de Valera ) used the name Iehova and gave a lengthy defense of the pronunciation Jehovah in its preface . Proponents of later origin Despite Jehovist claims that vowel signs are necessary for reading and understanding Hebrew , modern Hebrew ( apart from young children 's books , some formal poetry and Hebrew primers for new immigrants ) , is written without vowel points . The Torah scrolls do not include vowel points , and ancient Hebrew was written without vowel signs . The Dead Sea Scrolls , discovered in 1946 and dated from 400 BC to 70 AD , include texts from the Torah or Pentateuch and from other parts of the Hebrew Bible , and have provided documentary evidence that , in spite of claims to the contrary , the original Hebrew texts were in fact written without vowel points . Menahem Mansoor 's The Dead Sea Scrolls : A College Textbook and a Study Guide claims the vowel points found in printed Hebrew Bibles were devised in the 9th and 10th centuries . Gill 's view that the Hebrew vowel points were in use at the time of Ezra or even since the origin of the Hebrew language is stated in an early 19th - century study in opposition to `` the opinion of most learned men in modern times '' , according to whom the vowel points had been `` invented since the time of Christ '' . The study presented the following considerations : The argument that vowel points are necessary for learning to read Hebrew is refuted by the fact that the Samaritan text of the Bible is read without them and that several other Semitic languages , kindred to Hebrew , are written without any indications of the vowels . The books used in synagogue worship have always been without vowel points , which , unlike the letters , have thus never been treated as sacred . The Qere Kethib marginal notes give variant readings only of the letters , never of the points , an indication either that these were added later or that , if they already existed , they were seen as not so important . The Kabbalists drew their mysteries only from the letters and completely disregarded the points , if there were any . In several cases , ancient translations from the Hebrew Bible ( Septuagint , Targum , Aquila of Sinope , Symmachus , Theodotion , Jerome ) read the letters with vowels different from those indicated by the points , an indication that the texts from which they were translating were without points . The same holds for Origen 's transliteration of the Hebrew text into Greek letters . Jerome expressly speaks of a word in Habakkuk 3 : 5 , which in the present Masoretic Text has three consonant letters and two vowel points , as being of three letters and no vowel whatever . Neither the Jerusalem Talmud nor the Babylonian Talmud ( in all their recounting of Rabbinical disputes about the meaning of words ) , nor Philo nor Josephus , nor any Christian writer for several centuries after Christ make any reference to vowel points . Early modern arguments In the 16th and 17th centuries , various arguments were presented for and against the transcription of the form Jehovah . Discourses rejecting Jehovah Author Discourse Comments John Drusius ( Johannes Van den Driesche ) ( 1550 -- 1616 ) Tetragrammaton , sive de Nomine Die proprio , quod Tetragrammaton vocant ( 1604 ) Drusius stated `` Galatinus first led us to this mistake ... I know ( of ) nobody who read ( it ) thus earlier ... '' ). ( 4 ) An editor of Drusius in 1698 knows of an earlier reading in Porchetus de Salvaticis however . ( 5 ) John Drusius wrote that neither יְהֹוָה ‬ nor יֱהֹוִה ‬ accurately represented God 's name . Sixtinus Amama ( 1593 -- 1659 ) De nomine tetragrammato ( 1628 ) ( 6 ) Sixtinus Amama , was a Professor of Hebrew in the University of Franeker . A pupil of Drusius. ( 7 ) Louis Cappel ( 1585 -- 1658 ) De nomine tetragrammato ( 1624 ) Lewis Cappel reached the conclusion that Hebrew vowel points were not part of the original Hebrew language . This view was strongly contested by John Buxtorff the elder and his son . James Altingius ( 1618 -- 1679 ) Exercitatio grammatica de punctis ac pronunciatione tetragrammati James Altingius was a learned German divine . ( 8 ) Discourses defending Jehovah Author Discourse Comments Nicholas Fuller ( 1557 -- 1626 ) Dissertatio de nomine יהוה Nicholas was a Hebraist and a theologian. ( 9 ) John Buxtorf ( 1564 -- 1629 ) Disserto de nomine JHVH ( 1620 ) ; Tiberias , sive Commentarius Masoreticus ( 1664 ) John Buxtorf the elder ( 10 ) opposed the views of Elia Levita regarding the late origin ( invention by the Masoretes ) of the Hebrew vowel points , a subject which gave rise to the controversy between Louis Cappel and his ( e.g. John Buxtorf the elder 's ) son , Johannes Buxtorf II the younger . Johannes Buxtorf II ( 1599 -- 1664 ) Tractatus de punctorum origine , antiquitate , et authoritate , oppositus Arcano puntationis revelato Ludovici Cappelli ( 1648 ) Continued his father 's arguments that the pronunciation and therefore the Hebrew vowel points resulting in the name Jehovah have divine inspiration . Thomas Gataker ( 1574 -- 1654 ) ( 11 ) De Nomine Tetragrammato Dissertaio ( 1645 ) ( 12 ) See Memoirs of the Puritans Thomas Gataker . John Leusden ( 1624 -- 1699 ) Dissertationes tres , de vera lectione nominis Jehova John Leusden wrote three discourses in defense of the name Jehovah. ( 13 ) Summary of discourses In A Dictionary of the Bible ( 1863 ) , William Robertson Smith summarized these discourses , concluding that `` whatever , therefore , be the true pronunciation of the word , there can be little doubt that it is not Jehovah '' . Despite this , he consistently uses the name Jehovah throughout his dictionary and when translating Hebrew names . Some examples include Isaiah ( Jehovah 's help or salvation ) , Jehoshua ( Jehovah a helper ) , Jehu ( Jehovah is He ) . In the entry , Jehovah , Smith writes : `` JEHOVAH ( יְהֹוָה ‬ , usually with the vowel points of אֲדֹנָי ‬ ; but when the two occur together , the former is pointed יֱהֹוִה ‬ , that is with the vowels of אֱלֹהִים ‬ , as in Obad . i . 1 , Hab . iii. 19 : '' This practice is also observed in many modern publications , such as the New Compact Bible Dictionary ( Special Crusade Edition ) of 1967 and Peloubet 's Bible Dictionary of 1947 . Usage in English Bible translations The following versions of the Bible render the Tetragrammaton as Jehovah either exclusively or in selected verses : William Tyndale , in his 1530 translation of the first five books of the English Bible , at Exodus 6 : 3 renders the divine name as Iehovah . In his foreword to this edition he wrote : `` Iehovah is God 's name ... Moreover , as oft as thou seeist LORD in great letters ( except there be any error in the printing ) it is in Hebrew Iehovah . '' The Great Bible ( 1539 ) renders Jehovah in Psalm 33 : 12 and Psalm 83 : 18 .

In addition , `` Jehovah '' also appears 695 times in the Psalms and 87 times in Proverbs , totaling 1,021 instances . The Divine Name King James Bible ( 2011 ) replaces the capitalized GOD and LORD with the English translation Jehovah in 6,973 places . Non-usage The Douay Version of 1609 renders the phrase in Exodus 6 : 3 as `` and my name Adonai '' , and in its footnote says : `` Adonai is not the name here vttered to Moyses but is redde in place of the vnknowen name '' . The Challoner revision ( 1750 ) uses ADONAI with a note stating , `` some moderns have framed the name Jehovah , unknown to all the ancients , whether Jews or Christians . '' Various Messianic Jewish Bible translations use Adonai ( Complete Jewish Bible ( 1998 ) , Tree of Life Version ( 2014 ) or Hashem ( Orthodox Jewish Bible ( 2002 ) ) . A few sacred name Bibles use the Tetragrammaton instead of a generic title ( e.g. , the LORD ) or a conjectural transliteration ( e.g. , Yahweh or Jehovah ) : The Scriptures ( ISR ) Version ( 1993 , 1998 , 2009 ) Sacred Name King James Bible ( 2005 ) . HalleluYah Scriptures ( 2009 , 2015 ) .

A footnote on Exodus 3 : 15 says : `` The word LORD when spelled with capital letters , stands for the divine name , YHWH . '' The preface states : `` The word ' Jehovah ' does not accurately represent any form of the name ever used in Hebrew '' . The New American Bible ( 1970 , revised 1986 , 1991 ) . Its footnote to Genesis 4 : 25 -- 26 says : `` ... men began to call God by his personal name , Yahweh , rendered as `` the LORD '' in this version of the Bible . '' The New American Standard Bible ( 1971 , updated 1995 ) , another revision of the 1901 American Standard Version , followed the example of the Revised Standard Version . Its footnotes to Exodus 3 : 14 and 6 : 3 state : `` Related to the name of God , YHWH , rendered LORD , which is derived from the verb HAYAH , to be '' ; `` Heb YHWH , usually rendered LORD '' . In its preface it says : `` It is known that for many years YHWH has been transliterated as Yahweh , however no complete certainty attaches to this pronunciation .

'' The Common English Bible ( 2011 ) . The Modern English Version ( 2014 ) . A few translations use titles such as The Eternal : Moffatt , New Translation ( 1922 ) The Voice ( 2012 ) Some translations use both Yahweh and LORD : The Bible , An American Translation ( 1939 ) by J.M. Powis Smith and Edgar J. Goodspeed . Generally uses `` LORD '' but uses Yahweh and / or `` Yah '' exactly where Jehovah appears in the King James Version except in Psalms 83 : 18 , `` Yahweh '' also appears in Exodus 3 : 15 . The Amplified Bible ( 1965 , revised 1987 ) generally uses Lord , but translates Exodus 6 : 3 as : `` I appeared to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob as God Almighty ( El - Shaddai ) , but by My name the Lord ( Yahweh -- the redemptive name of God ) I did not make Myself known to them ( in acts and great miracles ) . '' The New Living Translation ( 1996 ) , produced by Tyndale House Publishers as a successor to the Living Bible , generally uses LORD , but uses Yahweh in Exodus 3 : 15 and 6 : 3 . The Holman Christian Standard Bible ( 2004 , revised 2008 ) mainly uses LORD , but in its second edition increased the number of times it uses Yahweh from 78 to 495 ( in 451 verses ) . Some translate the Tetragrammaton exclusively as Yahweh : Rotherham 's Emphasized Bible ( 1902 ) retains `` Yahweh '' throughout the Old Testament . The Jerusalem Bible ( 1966 ) . The Sacred Scriptures Bethel Edition ( 1981 ) is a Sacred Name Bible which uses the name `` Yahweh '' in both the Old and New Testaments ( Chamberlin p. 51 - 3 ) . It was produced by the Assemblies of Yahweh elder Jacob O. Meyer , based on the American Standard Version of 1901 . The New Jerusalem Bible ( 1985 ) . The Christian Community Bible ( 1988 ) is a translation of the Christian Bible in the English language originally produced in the Philippines and uses `` Yahweh '' . The World English Bible ( 1997 ) is based on the 1901 American Standard Version , but uses `` Yahweh '' instead of `` Jehovah '' . Hebraic Roots Bible ( 2009 , 2012 ) The Lexham English Bible ( 2011 ) uses `` Yahweh '' in the Old Testament . Names of God Bible ( 2011 , 2014 ) , edited by Ann Spangler and published by Baker Publishing Group . The core text of the 2011 edition uses the God 's Word translation . The core text of the 2014 edition uses the King James Version , and includes Jehovah next to Yahweh where `` LORD Jehovah '' appears in the source text . The print edition of both versions have divine names printed in brown and includes a commentary . Both editions use `` Yahweh '' in the Old Testament . Other usage The name `` Jehovah '' on the dome of the Old Catholic St. Martinskirche in Olten , Switzerland , 1521 Following the Middle Ages , some churches and public buildings across Europe , both before and after the Protestant Reformation were decorated with the name Jehovah . For example , the Coat of Arms of Plymouth ( UK ) City Council bears the Latin inscription , Turris fortissima est nomen Jehova ( English , `` The name of Jehovah is the strongest tower '' ) , derived from Proverbs 18 : 10 . Jehovah has been a popular English word for the personal name of God for several centuries . Christian hymns feature the name . The form `` Jehovah '' also appears in reference books and novels , for example , appearing several times in the novel The Greatest Story Ever Told by Roman Catholic author Fulton Oursler . Some religious groups , notably Jehovah 's Witnesses and proponents of the King - James - Only movement , make prominent use of the name . In Mormonism , `` Jehovah '' is thought to be the name by which Jesus was known prior to his birth ; references to `` the LORD '' in the KJV Old Testament are therefore understood to be references to the pre-mortal Jesus . God the Father , who is regarded as a separate individual , is sometimes referred to by the proper name `` Elohim '' . Similar Greek names Ancient Ιουω ( Iouō , ( juɔ ) ) : Pistis Sophia cited by Charles William King , which also gives Ιαω ( Iaō , ( jaɔ ) ( 2nd century ) Ιεου ( Ieou , ( jeu ) ) : Pistis Sophia ( 2nd century ) ΙΕΗΩΟΥΑ ( I-E - Ē - Ō - O-Y-A , ( ieɛɔoya ) ) , the seven vowels of the Greek alphabet arranged in this order . Charles William King attributes to a work that he calls On Interpretations the statement that this was the Egyptian name of the supreme God . He comments : `` This is in fact a very correct representation , if we give each vowel its true Greek sound , of the Hebrew pronunciation of the word Jehovah .

It is every where a proper name , denoting the personal God and him only ; whereas Elohim partakes more of the character of a common noun , denoting usually , indeed , but not necessarily nor uniformly , the Supreme . Elohim may be grammatically defined by the article , or by having a suffix attached to it , or by being in construction with a following noun . The Hebrew may say the Elohim , the true God , in opposition to all false gods ; but he never says the Jehovah , for Jehovah is the name of the true God only . He says again and again my God ; but never my Jehovah , for when he says my God , he means Jehovah . He speaks of the God of Israel , but never of the Jehovah of Israel , for there is no other Jehovah . He speaks of the living God , but never of the living Jehovah , for he can not conceive of Jehovah as other than living . It is obvious , therefore , that the name Elohim is the name of more general import , seeing that it admits of definition and limitation in these various ways ; whereas Jehovah is the more specific and personal name , altogether incapable of limitation .

The books of the King James Version include the 39 books of the Old Testament , an intertestamental section containing 14 books of the Apocrypha , and the 27 books of the New Testament . It was first printed by Robert Barker , the King 's Printer , and was the third translation into English approved by the English Church authorities : The first had been the Great Bible , commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII ( 1535 ) , and the second had been the Bishops ' Bible , commissioned in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I ( 1568 ) . In January 1604 , King James I convened the Hampton Court Conference , where a new English version was conceived in response to the problems of the earlier translations perceived by the Puritans , a faction of the Church of England . The translation is noted for its `` majesty of style '' , and has been described as one of the most important books in English culture and a driving force in the shaping of the English - speaking world . James gave the translators instructions intended to ensure that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology of , and reflect the episcopal structure of , the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy . The translation was done by 47 scholars , all of whom were members of the Church of England . In common with most other translations of the period , the New Testament was translated from Greek , the Old Testament from Hebrew and Aramaic , and the Apocrypha from Greek and Latin . In the Book of Common Prayer ( 1662 ) , the text of the Authorized Version replaced the text of the Great Bible for Epistle and Gospel readings ( but not for the Psalter , which substantially retained Coverdale 's Great Bible version ) , and as such was authorised by Act of Parliament . By the first half of the 18th century , the Authorized Version had become effectively unchallenged as the English translation used in Anglican and English Protestant churches , except for the Psalms and some short passages in the Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England . Over the course of the 18th century , the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English - speaking scholars . With the development of stereotype printing at the beginning of the 19th century , this version of the Bible became the most widely printed book in history , almost all such printings presenting the standard text of 1769 extensively re-edited by Benjamin Blayney at Oxford , and nearly always omitting the books of the Apocrypha . Today the unqualified title `` King James Version '' usually indicates this Oxford standard text . The KJV of 1611 used the 25 - letter English alphabet with no letter J , thus it was the King Iames Bible with `` Iesus Christ '' . It was the first revision 1629 Cambridge King James Authorized Bible that first used the modern 26 - letters and `` Jesus Christ '' .

The title page carries the words `` Appointed to be read in Churches '' , and F.F. Bruce suggests it was `` probably authorised by order in council '' but no record of the authorisation survives `` because the Privy Council registers from 1600 to 1613 were destroyed by fire in January 1618 / 19 '' . For many years it was common not to give the translation any specific name . In his Leviathan of 1651 , Thomas Hobbes referred to it as the English Translation made in the beginning of the Reign of King James . A 1761 `` Brief Account of the various Translations of the Bible into English '' refers to the 1611 version merely as a new , compleat , and more accurate Translation , despite referring to the Great Bible by its name , and despite using the name `` Rhemish Testament '' for the Douay - Rheims Bible version . Similarly , a `` History of England '' , whose fifth edition was published in 1775 , writes merely that ( a ) new translation of the Bible , viz. , that now in Use , was begun in 1607 , and published in 1611 . King James 's Bible is used as the name for the 1611 translation ( on a par with the `` Genevan Bible '' or the `` Rhemish Testament '' ) in Charles Butler 's Horae Biblicae ( first published 1797 ) . Other works from the early 19th century confirm the widespread use of this name on both sides of the Atlantic : it is found both in a `` Historical sketch of the English translations of the Bible '' published in Massachusetts in 1815 , and in an English publication from 1818 , which explicitly states that the 1611 version is `` generally known by the name of King James 's Bible '' . This name was also found as King James ' Bible ( without the final `` s '' ) : for example in a book review from 1811 . The phrase `` King James 's Bible '' is used as far back as 1715 , although in this case it is not clear whether this is a name or merely a description . The use of Authorized Version or Authorised Version , capitalized and used as a name , is found as early as 1814 . For some time before this , descriptive phrases such as `` our present , and only publicly authorised version '' ( 1783 ) , `` our Authorised version '' ( 1792 ) , and `` the authorized version '' ( 1801 , uncapitalized ) are found . The Oxford English Dictionary records a usage in 1824 . In Britain , the 1611 translation is generally known as the `` Authorised Version '' today . As early as 1814 , we find King James ' version , evidently a descriptive phrase , being used . `` The King James Version '' is found , unequivocally used as a name , in a letter from 1855 . The next year King James Bible , with no possessive , appears as a name in a Scottish source . In the United States , the `` 1611 translation '' ( actually editions following the standard text of 1769 , see below ) is generally known as the King James Version today . History ( edit ) Earlier English translations ( edit ) See also : English translations of the Bible The followers of John Wycliffe undertook the first complete English translations of the Christian scriptures in the 14th century . These translations were banned in 1409 due to their association with the Lollards . The Wycliffe Bible pre-dated the printing press but was circulated very widely in manuscript form , often inscribed with a date earlier than 1409 to avoid the legal ban . As the text translated in the various versions of the Wycliffe Bible was the Latin Vulgate , and as it contained no heterodox readings , there was in practice no way by which the ecclesiastical authorities could distinguish the banned version ; consequently many Catholic commentators of the 15th and 16th centuries ( such as Thomas More ) took these manuscript English Bibles to represent an anonymous earlier orthodox translation . William Tyndale translated the New Testament into English in 1525 . In 1525 , William Tyndale , an English contemporary of Martin Luther , undertook a translation of the New Testament . Tyndale 's translation was the first printed Bible in English . Over the next ten years , Tyndale revised his New Testament in the light of rapidly advancing biblical scholarship , and embarked on a translation of the Old Testament . Despite some controversial translation choices , and in spite of Tyndale 's execution on charges of heresy for having made the translated bible , the merits of Tyndale 's work and prose style made his translation the ultimate basis for all subsequent renditions into Early Modern English . With these translations lightly edited and adapted by Myles Coverdale , in 1539 , Tyndale 's New Testament and his incomplete work on the Old Testament became the basis for the Great Bible . This was the first `` authorised version '' issued by the Church of England during the reign of King Henry VIII . When Mary I succeeded to the throne in 1553 , she returned the Church of England to the communion of the Roman Catholic faith and many English religious reformers fled the country , some establishing an English - speaking colony at Geneva . Under the leadership of John Calvin , Geneva became the chief international centre of Reformed Protestantism and Latin biblical scholarship . These English expatriates undertook a translation that became known as the Geneva Bible . This translation , dated to 1560 , was a revision of Tyndale 's Bible and the Great Bible on the basis of the original languages . Soon after Elizabeth I took the throne in 1558 , the flaws of both the Great Bible and the Geneva Bible ( namely , that the Geneva Bible did not `` conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its beliefs about an ordained clergy '' ) became painfully apparent . In 1568 , the Church of England responded with the Bishops ' Bible , a revision of the Great Bible in the light of the Geneva version . While officially approved , this new version failed to displace the Geneva translation as the most popular English Bible of the age -- in part because the full Bible was only printed in lectern editions of prodigious size and at a cost of several pounds . Accordingly , Elizabethan lay people overwhelmingly read the Bible in the Geneva Version -- small editions were available at a relatively low cost . At the same time , there was a substantial clandestine importation of the rival Douay -- Rheims New Testament of 1582 , undertaken by exiled Roman Catholics . This translation , though still derived from Tyndale , claimed to represent the text of the Latin Vulgate . In May 1601 , King James VI of Scotland attended the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland at St Columba 's Church in Burntisland , Fife , at which proposals were put forward for a new translation of the Bible into English . Two years later , he ascended to the throne of England as James I . Considerations for a New Version ( edit ) The newly crowned King James convened the Hampton Court Conference in 1604 . That gathering proposed a new English version in response to the perceived problems of earlier translations as detected by the Puritan faction of the Church of England . Here are three examples of problems the Puritans perceived with the Bishops and Great Bibles : First , Galatians iv. 25 ( from the Bishops ' Bible ) . The Greek word susoichei is not well translated as now it is , bordereth neither expressing the force of the word , nor the apostle 's sense , nor the situation of the place . Secondly , psalm cv. 28 ( from the Great Bible ) , ' They were not obedient ; ' the original being , ' They were not disobedient . ' Thirdly , psalm cvi. 30 ( also from the Great Bible ) , ' Then stood up Phinees and prayed , ' the Hebrew hath , ' executed judgment . ' Instructions were given to the translators that were intended to limit the Puritan influence on this new translation . The Bishop of London added a qualification that the translators would add no marginal notes ( which had been an issue in the Geneva Bible ) . King James cited two passages in the Geneva translation where he found the marginal notes offensive to the principles of divinely ordained royal supremacy : Exodus 1 : 19 , where the Geneva Bible notes had commended the example of civil disobedience to the Egyptian Pharaoh showed by the Hebrew midwives , and also II Chronicles 15 : 16 , where the Geneva Bible had criticized King Asa for not having executed his idolatrous ' mother ' , Queen Maachah ( Maachah had actually been Asa 's grandmother , but James considered the Geneva Bible reference as sanctioning the execution of his own mother Mary , Queen of Scots ) . Further , the King gave the translators instructions designed to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology of the Church of England . Certain Greek and Hebrew words were to be translated in a manner that reflected the traditional usage of the church . For example , old ecclesiastical words such as the word `` church '' were to be retained and not to be translated as `` congregation '' . The new translation would reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and traditional beliefs about ordained clergy . James ' instructions included several requirements that kept the new translation familiar to its listeners and readers . The text of the Bishops ' Bible would serve as the primary guide for the translators , and the familiar proper names of the biblical characters would all be retained . If the Bishops ' Bible was deemed problematic in any situation , the translators were permitted to consult other translations from a pre-approved list : the Tyndale Bible , the Coverdale Bible , Matthew 's Bible , the Great Bible , and the Geneva Bible . In addition , later scholars have detected an influence on the Authorized Version from the translations of Taverner 's Bible and the New Testament of the Douay -- Rheims Bible . It is for this reason that the flyleaf of most printings of the Authorized Version observes that the text had been `` translated out of the original tongues , and with the former translations diligently compared and revised , by His Majesty 's special commandment . '' As the work proceeded , more detailed rules were adopted as to how variant and uncertain readings in the Hebrew and Greek source texts should be indicated , including the requirement that words supplied in English to ' complete the meaning ' of the originals should be printed in a different type face . The task of translation was undertaken by 47 scholars , although 54 were originally approved . All were members of the Church of England and all except Sir Henry Savile were clergy . The scholars worked in six committees , two based in each of the University of Oxford , the University of Cambridge , and Westminster . The committees included scholars with Puritan sympathies , as well as High Churchmen . Forty unbound copies of the 1602 edition of the Bishops ' Bible were specially printed so that the agreed changes of each committee could be recorded in the margins . The committees worked on certain parts separately and the drafts produced by each committee were then compared and revised for harmony with each other . The scholars were not paid directly for their translation work , instead a circular letter was sent to bishops encouraging them to consider the translators for appointment to well - paid livings as these fell vacant . Several were supported by the various colleges at Oxford and Cambridge , while others were promoted to bishoprics , deaneries and prebends through royal patronage . The committees started work towards the end of 1604 . King James I of England , on 22 July 1604 , sent a letter to Archbishop Bancroft asking him to contact all English churchmen requesting that they make donations to his project . Right trusty and well beloved , we greet you well . Whereas we have appointed certain learned men , to the number of 4 and 50 , for the translating of the Bible , and in this number , divers of them have either no ecclesiastical preferment at all , or else so very small , as the same is far unmeet for men of their deserts and yet we in ourself in any convenient time can not well remedy it , therefor we do hereby require you , that presently you write in our name as well to the Archbishop of York , as to the rest of the bishops of the province of Cant. ( erbury ) signifying unto them , that we do well and straitly charge everyone of them ... that ( all excuses set apart ) when a prebend or parsonage ... shall next upon any occasion happen to be void ... we may commend for the same some such of the learned men , as we shall think fit to be preferred unto it ... Given unto our signet at our palace of West. ( minister ) on 2 and 20 July , in the 2nd year of our reign of England , France , and of Ireland , and of Scotland xxxvii . '' They had all completed their sections by 1608 , the Apocrypha committee finishing first . From January 1609 , a General Committee of Review met at Stationers ' Hall , London to review the completed marked texts from each of the six committees . The General Committee included John Bois , Andrew Downes and John Harmar , and others known only by their initials , including `` AL '' ( who may be Arthur Lake ) , and were paid for their attendance by the Stationers ' Company . John Bois prepared a note of their deliberations ( in Latin ) -- which has partly survived in two later transcripts . Also surviving of the translators ' working papers are a bound - together set of marked - up corrections to one of the forty Bishops ' Bibles -- covering the Old Testament and Gospels , and also a manuscript translation of the text of the Epistles , excepting those verses where no change was being recommended to the readings in the Bishops ' Bible . Archbishop Bancroft insisted on having a final say making fourteen further changes , of which one was the term `` bishopricke '' at Acts 1 : 20 . Translation committees ( edit ) First Westminster Company , translated Genesis to 2 Kings : Lancelot Andrewes , John Overall , Hadrian à Saravia , Richard Clarke , John Layfield , Robert Tighe , Francis Burleigh , Geoffrey King , Richard Thomson , William Bedwell ; First Cambridge Company , translated 1 Chronicles to the Song of Solomon : Edward Lively , John Richardson , Lawrence Chaderton , Francis Dillingham , Roger Andrewes , Thomas Harrison , Robert Spaulding , Andrew Bing ; First Oxford Company , translated Isaiah to Malachi : John Harding , John Rainolds ( or Reynolds ) , Thomas Holland , Richard Kilby , Miles Smith , Richard Brett , Daniel Fairclough , William Thorne ; Second Oxford Company , translated the Gospels , Acts of the Apostles , and the Book of Revelation : Thomas Ravis , George Abbot , Richard Eedes , Giles Tomson , Sir Henry Savile , John Peryn , Ralph Ravens , John Harmar , John Aglionby , Leonard Hutten ; Second Westminster Company , translated the Epistles : William Barlow , John Spenser , Roger Fenton , Ralph Hutchinson , William Dakins , Michael Rabbet , Thomas Sanderson ( who probably had already become Archdeacon of Rochester ) ; Second Cambridge Company , translated the Apocrypha : John Duport , William Branthwaite , Jeremiah Radcliffe , Samuel Ward , Andrew Downes , John Bois , Robert Ward , Thomas Bilson , Richard Bancroft . Printing ( edit ) Archbishop Richard Bancroft was the `` chief overseer '' of the production of the Authorized Version . The original printing of the Authorized Version was published by Robert Barker , the King 's Printer , in 1611 as a complete folio Bible . It was sold looseleaf for ten shillings , or bound for twelve . Robert Barker 's father , Christopher , had , in 1589 , been granted by Elizabeth I the title of royal Printer , with the perpetual Royal Privilege to print Bibles in England . Robert Barker invested very large sums in printing the new edition , and consequently ran into serious debt , such that he was compelled to sub-lease the privilege to two rival London printers , Bonham Norton and John Bill . It appears that it was initially intended that each printer would print a portion of the text , share printed sheets with the others , and split the proceeds . Bitter financial disputes broke out , as Barker accused Norton and Bill of concealing their profits , while Norton and Bill accused Barker of selling sheets properly due to them as partial Bibles for ready money . There followed decades of continual litigation , and consequent imprisonment for debt for members of the Barker and Norton printing dynasties , while each issued rival editions of the whole Bible . In 1629 the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge successfully managed to assert separate and prior royal licences for Bible printing , for their own university presses -- and Cambridge University took the opportunity to print revised editions of the Authorized Version in 1629 , and 1638 . The editors of these editions included John Bois and John Ward from the original translators . This did not , however , impede the commercial rivalries of the London printers , especially as the Barker family refused to allow any other printers access to the authoritative manuscript of the Authorized Version . Two editions of the whole Bible are recognized as having been produced in 1611 , which may be distinguished by their rendering of Ruth 3 : 15 ; the first edition reading `` he went into the city '' , where the second reads `` she went into the city . '' ; these are known colloquially as the `` He '' and `` She '' Bibles . The opening of the Epistle to the Hebrews of the 1611 edition of the Authorized Version shows the original typeface . Marginal notes reference variant translations and cross references to other Bible passages . Each chapter is headed by a précis of contents . There are decorative initial letters for each Chapter , and a decorated headpiece to each Biblical Book , but no illustrations in the text . The original printing was made before English spelling was standardized , and when printers , as a matter of course , expanded and contracted the spelling of the same words in different places , so as to achieve an even column of text . They set v for initial u and v , and u for u and v everywhere else . They used long s for non-final s . The glyph j occurs only after i , as in the final letter in a Roman numeral . Punctuation was relatively heavy and differed from current practice . When space needed to be saved , the printers sometimes used ye for the , ( replacing the Middle English thorn with the continental y ) , set ã for an or am ( in the style of scribe 's shorthand ) , and set & for and . On the contrary , on a few occasions , they appear to have inserted these words when they thought a line needed to be padded . Later printings regularized these spellings ; the punctuation has also been standardized , but still varies from current usage norms . The first printing used a black letter typeface instead of a roman typeface , which itself made a political and a religious statement . Like the Great Bible and the Bishops ' Bible , the Authorized Version was `` appointed to be read in churches '' . It was a large folio volume meant for public use , not private devotion ; the weight of the type mirrored the weight of establishment authority behind it . However , smaller editions and roman - type editions followed rapidly , e.g. quarto roman - type editions of the Bible in 1612 . This contrasted with the Geneva Bible , which was the first English Bible printed in a roman typeface ( although black - letter editions , particularly in folio format , were issued later ) . In contrast to the Geneva Bible and the Bishops ' Bible , which had both been extensively illustrated , there were no illustrations at all in the 1611 edition of the Authorized Version , the main form of decoration being the historiated initial letters provided for books and chapters -- together with the decorative title pages to the Bible itself , and to the New Testament . In the Great Bible , readings derived from the Vulgate but not found in published Hebrew and Greek texts had been distinguished by being printed in smaller roman type . In the Geneva Bible , a distinct typeface had instead been applied to distinguish text supplied by translators , or thought needful for English grammar but not present in the Greek or Hebrew ; and the original printing of the Authorized Version used roman type for this purposed , albeit sparsely and inconsistently . This results in perhaps the most significant difference between the original printed text of the King James Bible and the current text . When , from the later 17th century onwards , the Authorized Version began to be printed in roman type , the typeface for supplied words was changed to italics , this application being regularised and greatly expanded . This was intended to de-emphasise the words . The original printing contained two prefatory texts ; the first was a formal Epistle Dedicatory to `` the most high and mighty Prince '' King James . Many British printings reproduce this , while most non-British printings do not . The second preface was called Translators to the Reader , a long and learned essay that defends the undertaking of the new version . It observes the translators ' stated goal , that they , `` never thought from the beginning that ( they ) should need to make a new translation , nor yet to make of a bad one a good one , ... but to make a good one better , or out of many good ones , one principal good one , not justly to be excepted against ; that hath been our endeavour , that our mark . '' They also give their opinion of previous English Bible translations , stating , `` We do not deny , nay , we affirm and avow , that the very meanest translation of the Bible in English , set forth by men of our profession , ( for we have seen none of theirs ( Roman Catholics ) of the whole Bible as yet ) containeth the word of God , nay , is the word of God . '' As with the first preface , some British printings reproduce this , while most non-British printings do not . Almost every printing that includes the second preface also includes the first . The first printing contained a number of other apparatus , including a table for the reading of the Psalms at matins and evensong , and a calendar , an almanac , and a table of holy days and observances . Much of this material became obsolete with the adoption of the Gregorian Calendar by Britain and its colonies in 1752 , and thus modern editions invariably omit it . So as to make it easier to locate a particular passage , each chapter was headed by a brief precis of its contents with verse numbers . Later editors freely substituted their own chapter summaries , or omitted such material entirely . Pilcrow marks are used to indicate the beginnings of paragraphs except after the book of Acts . Authorized Version ( edit ) The Authorized Version was meant to replace the Bishops ' Bible as the official version for readings in the Church of England . No record of its authorization exists ; it was probably effected by an order of the Privy Council but the records for the years 1600 to 1613 were destroyed by fire in January 1618 / 19 and it is commonly known as the Authorized Version in the United Kingdom . The King 's Printer issued no further editions of the Bishops ' Bible , so necessarily the Authorized Version replaced it as the standard lectern Bible in parish church use in England . In the 1662 Book of Common Prayer , the text of the Authorized Version finally supplanted that of the Great Bible in the Epistle and Gospel readings -- though the Prayer Book Psalter nevertheless continues in the Great Bible version . The case was different in Scotland , where the Geneva Bible had long been the standard church bible . It was not until 1633 that a Scottish edition of the Authorized Version was printed -- in conjunction with the Scots coronation in that year of Charles I . The inclusion of illustrations in the edition raised accusations of Popery from opponents of the religious policies of Charles and William Laud , Archbishop of Canterbury . However , official policy favoured the Authorized Version , and this favour returned during the Commonwealth -- as London printers succeeded in re-asserting their monopoly on Bible printing with support from Oliver Cromwell -- and the `` New Translation '' was the only edition on the market . F.F. Bruce reports that the last recorded instance of a Scots parish continuing to use the `` Old Translation '' ( i.e. Geneva ) as being in 1674 . The Authorized Version 's acceptance by the general public took longer . The Geneva Bible continued to be popular , and large numbers were imported from Amsterdam , where printing continued up to 1644 in editions carrying a false London imprint . However , few if any genuine Geneva editions appear to have been printed in London after 1616 , and in 1637 Archbishop Laud prohibited their printing or importation . In the period of the English Civil War , soldiers of the New Model Army were issued a book of Geneva selections called `` The Soldiers ' Bible '' . In the first half of the 17th century the Authorized Version is most commonly referred to as `` The Bible without notes '' , thereby distinguishing it from the Geneva `` Bible with notes '' . There were several printings of the Authorized Version in Amsterdam -- one as late as 1715 which combined the Authorized Version translation text with the Geneva marginal notes ; one such edition was printed in London in 1649 . During the Commonwealth a commission was established by Parliament to recommend a revision of the Authorized Version with acceptably Protestant explanatory notes , but the project was abandoned when it became clear that these would nearly double the bulk of the Bible text . After the English Restoration , the Geneva Bible was held to be politically suspect and a reminder of the repudiated Puritan era . Furthermore , disputes over the lucrative rights to print the Authorized Version dragged on through the 17th century , so none of the printers involved saw any commercial advantage in marketing a rival translation . The Authorized Version became the only current version circulating among English - speaking people . A small minority of critical scholars were slow to accept the latest translation . Hugh Broughton , who was the most highly regarded English Hebraist of his time but had been excluded from the panel of translators because of his utterly uncongenial temperament , issued in 1611 a total condemnation of the new version . He especially criticized the translators ' rejection of word - for - word equivalence and stated that `` he would rather be torn in pieces by wild horses than that this abominable translation ( KJV ) should ever be foisted upon the English people '' . Walton 's London Polyglot of 1657 disregards the Authorized Version ( and indeed the English language ) entirely . Walton 's reference text throughout is the Vulgate . The Vulgate Latin is also found as the standard text of scripture in Thomas Hobbes 's Leviathan of 1651 , indeed Hobbes gives Vulgate chapter and verse numbers ( e.g. , Job 41 : 24 , not Job 41 : 33 ) for his head text . In Chapter 35 : ' The Signification in Scripture of Kingdom of God ' , Hobbes discusses Exodus 19 : 5 , first in his own translation of the ' Vulgar Latin ' , and then subsequently as found in the versions he terms `` ... the English translation made in the beginning of the reign of King James '' , and `` The Geneva French '' ( i.e. Olivétan ) . Hobbes advances detailed critical arguments why the Vulgate rendering is to be preferred . For most of the 17th century the assumption remained that , while it had been of vital importance to provide the scriptures in the vernacular for ordinary people , nevertheless for those with sufficient education to do so , Biblical study was best undertaken within the international common medium of Latin . It was only in 1700 that modern bilingual Bibles appeared in which the Authorized Version was compared with counterpart Dutch and French Protestant vernacular Bibles . In consequence of the continual disputes over printing privileges , successive printings of the Authorized Version were notably less careful than the 1611 edition had been -- compositors freely varying spelling , capitalization and punctuation -- and also , over the years , introducing about 1,500 misprints ( some of which , like the omission of `` not '' from the commandment `` Thou shalt not commit adultery '' in the `` Wicked Bible '' , became notorious ) . The two Cambridge editions of 1629 and 1638 attempted to restore the proper text -- while introducing over 200 revisions of the original translators ' work , chiefly by incorporating into the main text a more literal reading originally presented as a marginal note . A more thoroughly corrected edition was proposed following the Restoration , in conjunction with the revised 1662 Book of Common Prayer , but Parliament then decided against it . By the first half of the 18th century , the Authorized Version was effectively unchallenged as the sole English translation in current use in Protestant churches , and was so dominant that the Roman Catholic Church in England issued in 1750 a revision of the 1610 Douay - Rheims Bible by Richard Challoner that was very much closer to the Authorized Version than to the original . However , general standards of spelling , punctuation , typesetting , capitalization and grammar had changed radically in the 100 years since the first edition of the Authorized Version , and all printers in the market were introducing continual piecemeal changes to their Bible texts to bring them into line with current practice -- and with public expectations of standardized spelling and grammatical construction . Over the course of the 18th century , the Authorized Version supplanted the Hebrew , Greek and the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English speaking scholars and divines , and indeed came to be regarded by some as an inspired text in itself -- so much so that any challenge to its readings or textual base came to be regarded by many as an assault on Holy Scripture . This has been contemptuously labelled `` AVolatry '' , a play on the name `` Authorized Version '' ( AV ) and idolatry . Standard text of 1769 ( edit ) Title page of the 1760 Cambridge edition By the mid-18th century the wide variation in the various modernized printed texts of the Authorized Version , combined with the notorious accumulation of misprints , had reached the proportion of a scandal , and the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge both sought to produce an updated standard text . First of the two was the Cambridge edition of 1760 , the culmination of 20 - years work by Francis Sawyer Parris , who died in May of that year . This 1760 edition was reprinted without change in 1762 and in John Baskerville 's fine folio edition of 1763 . This was effectively superseded by the 1769 Oxford edition , edited by Benjamin Blayney , though with comparatively few changes from Parris 's edition ; but which became the Oxford standard text , and is reproduced almost unchanged in most current printings . Parris and Blayney sought consistently to remove those elements of the 1611 and subsequent editions that they believed were due to the vagaries of printers , while incorporating most of the revised readings of the Cambridge editions of 1629 and 1638 , and each also introducing a few improved readings of their own . They undertook the mammoth task of standardizing the wide variation in punctuation and spelling of the original , making many thousands of minor changes to the text . In addition , Blayney and Parris thoroughly revised and greatly extended the italicization of `` supplied '' words not found in the original languages by cross-checking against the presumed source texts . Blayney seems to have worked from the 1550 Stephanus edition of the Textus Receptus , rather than the later editions of Beza that the translators of the 1611 New Testament had favoured ; accordingly the current Oxford standard text alters around a dozen italicizations where Beza and Stephanus differ . Like the 1611 edition , the 1769 Oxford edition included the Apocrypha , although Blayney tended to remove cross-references to the Books of the Apocrypha from the margins of their Old and New Testaments wherever these had been provided by the original translators . Altogether , the standardization of spelling and punctuation caused Blayney 's 1769 text to differ from the 1611 text in around 24,000 places . Since that date , a few further changes have been introduced to the Oxford standard text . The Oxford University Press paperback edition of the `` Authorized King James Version '' provides Oxford 's standard text , and also includes the prefatory section `` The Translators to the Reader '' . The 1611 and 1769 texts of the first three verses from I Corinthians 13 are given below . ( 1611 ) 1 . Though I speake with the tongues of men & of Angels , and haue not charity , I am become as sounding brasse or a tinkling cymbal. 2 And though I haue the gift of prophesie , and vnderstand all mysteries and all knowledge : and though I haue all faith , so that I could remooue mountaines , and haue no charitie , I am nothing . 3 And though I bestowe all my goods to feede the poore , and though I giue my body to bee burned , and haue not charitie , it profiteth me nothing . ( 1769 ) 1 . Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels , and have not charity , I am become as sounding brass , or a tinkling cymbal. 2 And though I have the gift of prophecy , and understand all mysteries , and all knowledge ; and though I have all faith , so that I could remove mountains , and have not charity , I am nothing . 3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor , and though I give my body to be burned , and have not charity , it profiteth me nothing . There are a number of superficial edits in these three verses : 11 changes of spelling , 16 changes of typesetting ( including the changed conventions for the use of u and v ) , three changes of punctuation , and one variant text -- where `` not charity '' is substituted for `` no charity '' in verse two , in the erroneous belief that the original reading was a misprint . A particular verse for which Blayney 's 1769 text differs from Parris 's 1760 version is Matthew 5 : 13 , where Parris ( 1760 ) has Ye are the salt of the earth : but if the salt have lost his savour , wherewith shall it be salted ? it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out , and to be troden under foot of men . Blayney ( 1769 ) changes ' lost his savour ' to ' lost its savour ' , and troden to trodden . For a period , Cambridge continued to issue Bibles using the Parris text , but the market demand for absolute standardization was now such that they eventually adapted Blayney 's work but omitted some of the idiosyncratic Oxford spellings . By the mid-19th century , almost all printings of the Authorized Version were derived from the 1769 Oxford text -- increasingly without Blayney 's variant notes and cross references , and commonly excluding the Apocrypha . One exception to this was a scrupulous original - spelling , page - for - page , and line - for - line reprint of the 1611 edition ( including all chapter headings , marginalia , and original italicization , but with Roman type substituted for the black letter of the original ) , published by Oxford in 1833 . Another important exception was the 1873 Cambridge Paragraph Bible , thoroughly revised , modernized and re-edited by F.H.A. Scrivener , who for the first time consistently identified the source texts underlying the 1611 translation and its marginal notes . Scrivener , like Blayney , opted to revise the translation where he considered the judgement of the 1611 translators had been faulty . In 2005 , Cambridge University Press released its New Cambridge Paragraph Bible with Apocrypha , edited by David Norton , which followed in the spirit of Scrivener 's work , attempting to bring spelling to present - day standards . Norton also innovated with the introduction of quotation marks , while returning to a hypothetical 1611 text , so far as possible , to the wording used by its translators , especially in the light of the re-emphasis on some of their draft documents . This text has been issued in paperback by Penguin books . From the early 19th century the Authorized Version has remained almost completely unchanged -- and since , due to advances in printing technology , it could now be produced in very large editions for mass sale , it established complete dominance in public and ecclesiastical use in the English - speaking Protestant world . Academic debate through that century , however , increasingly reflected concerns about the Authorized Version shared by some scholars : ( a ) that subsequent study in oriental languages suggested a need to revise the translation of the Hebrew Bible -- both in terms of specific vocabulary , and also in distinguishing descriptive terms from proper names ; ( b ) that the Authorized Version was unsatisfactory in translating the same Greek words and phrases into different English , especially where parallel passages are found in the synoptic gospels ; and ( c ) in the light of subsequent ancient manuscript discoveries , the New Testament translation base of the Greek Textus Receptus could no longer be considered to be the best representation of the original text . Responding to these concerns , the Convocation of Canterbury resolved in 1870 to undertake a revision of the text of the Authorized Version , intending to retain the original text `` except where in the judgement of competent scholars such a change is necessary '' . The resulting revision was issued as the Revised Version in 1881 ( New Testament ) , 1885 ( Old Testament ) and 1894 ( Apocrypha ) ; but , although it sold widely , the revision did not find popular favour , and it was only reluctantly in 1899 that Convocation approved it for reading in churches . By the early 20th century , editing had been completed in Cambridge 's text , with at least 6 new changes since 1769 , and the reversing of at least 30 of the standard Oxford readings . The distinct Cambridge text was printed in the millions , and after the Second World War `` the unchanging steadiness of the KJB was a huge asset . '' The Cambridge edition is preferred by scholars . The Authorized Version maintained its effective dominance throughout the first half of the 20th century . New translations in the second half of the 20th century displaced its 250 years of dominance ( roughly 1700 to 1950 ) , but groups do exist -- sometimes termed the King James Only movement -- that distrust anything not in agreement with the Authorized Version . Editorial criticism ( edit ) F.H.A. Scrivener and D. Norton have both written in detail on editorial variations which have occurred through the history of the publishing of the Authorized Version from 1611 to 1769 . In the 19th century , there were effectively three main guardians of the text . Norton identified five variations among the Oxford , Cambridge and London ( Eyre and Spottiswoode ) texts of 1857 , such as the spelling of `` farther '' or `` further '' at Matthew 26 : 39 . In the 20th century , variation between the editions was reduced to comparing the Cambridge to the Oxford . Distinctly identified Cambridge readings included `` or Sheba '' ( Joshua 19 : 2 ) , `` sin '' ( 2 Chronicles 33 : 19 ) , `` clifts '' ( Job 30 : 6 ) , `` vapour '' ( Psalm 148 : 8 ) , `` flieth '' ( Nahum 3 : 16 ) , `` further '' ( Matthew 26 : 39 ) and a number of other references . In effect the Cambridge was considered the current text in comparison to the Oxford . These are instances where both Oxford and Cambridge have now diverged from Blayney 's 1769 Edition . The distinctions between the Oxford and Cambridge editions have been a major point in the Bible version debate , and a potential theological issue , particularly in regard to the identification of the Pure Cambridge Edition . Cambridge University Press introduced a change at 1 John 5 : 8 in 1985 , reversing its longstanding tradition of printing the word `` spirit '' in lower case by using a capital letter `` S '' .

Hardin of Bedford , Pennsylvania , wrote a letter to Cambridge inquiring about this verse , and subsequently received a reply from Dr. Cooper on June 3 , 1985 , admitting that it was a `` matter of some embarrassment regarding the lower case ' s ' in Spirit '' . Literary attributes ( edit ) Translation ( edit ) Like Tyndale 's translation and the Geneva Bible , the Authorized Version was translated primarily from Greek , Hebrew and Aramaic texts , although with secondary reference both to the Latin Vulgate , and to more recent scholarly Latin versions ; two books of the Apocrypha were translated from a Latin source . Following the example of the Geneva Bible , words implied but not actually in the original source were distinguished by being printed in distinct type ( albeit inconsistently ) , but otherwise the translators explicitly rejected word - for - word equivalence . F.F Bruce gives an example from Romans Chapter 5 : 2 By whom also wee have accesse by faith , into this grace wherein wee stand , and rejoyce in hope of the glory of God . 3 And not onely so , but we glory in tribulations also , knowing that tribulation worketh patience : The English terms `` rejoice '' and `` glory '' stand for the same word in the Greek original . In Tyndale , Geneva and the Bishops ' Bibles , both instances are translated `` rejoice '' . In the Douay -- Rheims New Testament , both are translated `` glory '' . Only in the Authorized Version does the translation vary between the two verses . In obedience to their instructions , the translators provided no marginal interpretation of the text , but in some 8,500 places a marginal note offers an alternative English wording . The majority of these notes offer a more literal rendering of the original ( introduced as `` Heb '' , `` Chal '' , `` Gr '' or `` Lat '' ) , but others indicate a variant reading of the source text ( introduced by `` or '' ) . Some of the annotated variants derive from alternative editions in the original languages , or from variant forms quoted in the fathers . More commonly , though , they indicate a difference between the literal original language reading and that in the translators ' preferred recent Latin versions : Tremellius for the Old Testament , Junius for the Apocrypha , and Beza for the New Testament . At thirteen places in the New Testament ( e.g. Luke 17 : 36 and Acts 25 : 6 ) a marginal note records a variant reading found in some Greek manuscript copies ; in almost all cases reproducing a counterpart textual note at the same place in Beza 's editions . A few more extensive notes clarify Biblical names and units of measurement or currency . Modern reprintings rarely reproduce these annotated variants -- although they are to be found in the New Cambridge Paragraph Bible . In addition , there were originally some 9,000 scriptural cross-references , in which one text was related to another . Such cross-references had long been common in Latin Bibles , and most of those in the Authorized Version were copied unaltered from this Latin tradition . Consequently the early editions of the KJV retain many Vulgate verse references -- e.g. in the numbering of the Psalms . At the head of each chapter , the translators provided a short précis of its contents , with verse numbers ; these are rarely included in complete form in modern editions . Also in obedience to their instructions , the translators indicated ' supplied ' words in a different typeface ; but there was no attempt to regularise the instances where this practice had been applied across the different companies ; and especially in the New Testament , it was used much less frequently in the 1611 edition than would later be the case . In one verse , 1 John 2 : 23 , an entire clause was printed in roman type ( as it had also been in the Great Bible and Bishop 's Bible ) ; indicating a reading then primarily derived from the Vulgate , albeit one for which the later editions of Beza had provided a Greek text . In the Old Testament the translators render the Tetragrammaton YHWH by `` the LORD '' ( in later editions in small capitals as LORD ) , or `` the LORD God '' ( for YHWH Elohim , יהוה אלהים ) , except in four places by `` IEHOVAH '' ( Exodus 6 : 3 , Psalm 83 : 18 , Isaiah 12 : 2 and Isaiah 26 : 4 ) and three times in a combination form . ( Genesis 22 : 14 , Exodus 17 : 15 , Judges 6 : 24 ) However , if the Tetragrammaton occurs with the Hebrew word adonai ( Lord ) then it is rendered not as the `` Lord LORD '' but as the `` Lord God '' . ( Psalm 73 : 28 , etc . ) In later editions as `` Lord GOD '' with `` GOD '' in small capitals indicating to the reader that God 's name appears in the original Hebrew . Old Testament ( edit ) For their Old Testament , the translators used a text originating in the editions of the Hebrew Rabbinic Bible by Daniel Bomberg ( 1524 / 5 ) , but adjusted this to conform to the Greek LXX or Latin Vulgate in passages to which Christian tradition had attached a Christological interpretation . For example , the Septuagint reading `` They pierced my hands and my feet '' was used in Psalm 22 : 16 ( vs. the Masoretes ' reading of the Hebrew `` like lions my hands and feet '' ) . Otherwise , however , the Authorized Version is closer to the Hebrew tradition than any previous English translation -- especially in making use of the rabbinic commentaries , such as Kimhi , in elucidating obscure passages in the Masoretic Text ; earlier versions had been more likely to adopt LXX or Vulgate readings in such places . Following the practice of the Geneva Bible , the books of 1 Esdras and 2 Esdras in the medieval Vulgate Old Testament were renamed ' Ezra ' and ' Nehemiah ' ; 3 Esdras and 4 Esdras in the Apocrypha being renamed ' 1 Esdras ' and ' 2 Esdras ' . New Testament ( edit ) For their New Testament , the translators chiefly used the 1598 and 1588 / 89 Greek editions of Theodore Beza , which also present Beza 's Latin version of the Greek and Stephanus 's edition of the Latin Vulgate . Both of these versions were extensively referred to , as the translators conducted all discussions amongst themselves in Latin . F.H.A. Scrivener identifies 190 readings where the Authorized Version translators depart from Beza 's Greek text , generally in maintaining the wording of the Bishop 's Bible and other earlier English translations . In about half of these instances , the Authorized Version translators appear to follow the earlier 1550 Greek Textus Receptus of Stephanus . For the other half , Scrivener was usually able to find corresponding Greek readings in the editions of Erasmus , or in the Complutensian Polyglot . However , in several dozen readings he notes that no printed Greek text corresponds to the English of the Authorized Version , which in these places derives directly from the Vulgate . For example , at John 10 : 16 , the Authorized Version reads `` one fold '' ( as did the Bishops ' Bible , and the 16th - century vernacular versions produced in Geneva ) , following the Latin Vulgate `` unum ovile '' , whereas Tyndale had agreed more closely with the Greek , `` one flocke '' ( μία ποίμνη ) . The Authorized Version New Testament owes much more to the Vulgate than does the Old Testament ; still , at least 80 % of the text is unaltered from Tyndale 's translation . Apocrypha ( edit ) Unlike the rest of the Bible , the translators of the Apocrypha identified their source texts in their marginal notes . From these it can be determined that the books of the Apocrypha were translated from the Septuagint -- primarily , from the Greek Old Testament column in the Antwerp Polyglot -- but with extensive reference to the counterpart Latin Vulgate text , and to Junius 's Latin translation . The translators record references to the Sixtine Septuagint of 1587 , which is substantially a printing of the Old Testament text from the Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209 , and also to the 1518 Greek Septuagint edition of Aldus Manutius . They had , however , no Greek texts for 2 Esdras , or for the Prayer of Manasses , and Scrivener found that they here used an unidentified Latin manuscript . Sources ( edit ) The translators appear to have otherwise made no first - hand study of ancient manuscript sources , even those that -- like the Codex Bezae -- would have been readily available to them . In addition to all previous English versions ( including , and contrary to their instructions , the Rheimish New Testament which in their preface they criticized ) ; they made wide and eclectic use of all printed editions in the original languages then available , including the ancient Syriac New Testament printed with an interlinear Latin gloss in the Antwerp Polyglot of 1573 . In the preface the translators acknowledge consulting translations and commentaries in Chaldee , Hebrew , Syrian , Greek , Latin , Spanish , French , Italian , and German . The translators took the Bishop 's Bible as their source text , and where they departed from that in favour of another translation , this was most commonly the Geneva Bible . However , the degree to which readings from the Bishop 's Bible survived into final text of the King James Bible varies greatly from company to company , as did the propensity of the King James translators to coin phrases of their own . John Bois 's notes of the General Committee of Review show that they discussed readings derived from a wide variety of versions and patristic sources ; including explicitly both Henry Savile 's 1610 edition of the works of John Chrysostom and the Rheims New Testament , which was the primary source for many of the literal alternative readings provided for the marginal notes . Variations from recent translations ( edit ) Main article : List of major textual variants in the New Testament See also : List of Bible verses not included in modern translations A number of Bible verses in the King James Version of the New Testament are not found in more recent Bible translations , where these are based on modern critical texts . In the early seventeenth century , the source Greek texts of the New Testament used for the production of Protestant bible versions depended mainly on manuscripts of the late Byzantine text - type , and with minor variations contained what became known as the Textus Receptus . With the subsequent identification of much earlier manuscripts , most modern textual scholars value the evidence of manuscripts belonging to the Alexandrian family as better witnesses to the original text of the biblical authors , without giving it , or any family , automatic preference . Style and criticism ( edit ) A primary concern of the translators was to produce an appropriate Bible , dignified and resonant in public reading . Although the Authorized Version 's written style is an important part of its influence on English , research has found only one verse -- Hebrews 13 : 8 -- for which translators debated the wording 's literary merits . While they stated in the preface that they used stylistic variation , finding multiple English words or verbal forms in places where the original language employed repetition , in practice they also did the opposite ; for example , 14 different Hebrew words were translated into the single English word `` prince '' . In a period of rapid linguistic change the translators avoided contemporary idioms , tending instead towards forms that were already slightly archaic , like verily and it came to pass . The pronouns thou / thee and ye / you are consistently used as singular and plural respectively , even though by this time you was often found as the singular in general English usage , especially when addressing a social superior ( as is evidenced , for example , in Shakespeare ) . For the possessive of the third person pronoun , the word its , first recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1598 , is avoided . The older his is usually employed , as for example at Matthew 5 : 13 : `` if the salt have lost his savour , wherewith shall it be salted ? '' ; in other places of it , thereof or bare it are found . Another sign of linguistic conservativism is the invariable use of - eth for the third person singular present form of the verb , as at Matthew 2 : 13 : `` the Angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dreame '' . The rival ending - ( e ) s , as found in present - day English , was already widely used by this time ( for example , it predominates over - eth in the plays of Shakespeare and Marlowe ) . Furthermore , the translators preferred which to who or whom as the relative pronoun for persons , as in Genesis 13 : 5 : `` And Lot also which went with Abram , had flocks and heards , & tents '' although who ( m ) is also found . The Authorized Version is notably more Latinate than previous English versions , especially the Geneva Bible . This results in part from the academic stylistic preferences of a number of the translators -- several of whom admitted to being more comfortable writing in Latin than in English -- but was also , in part , a consequence of the royal proscription against explanatory notes . Hence , where the Geneva Bible might use a common English word -- and gloss its particular application in a marginal note -- the Authorized Version tends rather to prefer a technical term , frequently in Anglicized Latin . Consequently , although the King had instructed the translators to use the Bishops ' Bible as a base text , the New Testament in particular owes much stylistically to the Catholic Rheims New Testament , whose translators had also been concerned to find English equivalents for Latin terminology . In addition , the translators of the New Testament books transliterate names found in the Old Testament in their Greek forms rather than in the forms closer to the Old Testament Hebrew ( e.g. `` Elias '' and `` Noe '' for `` Elijah '' and `` Noah '' , respectively ) . While the Authorized Version remains among the most widely sold , modern critical New Testament translations differ substantially from it in a number of passages , primarily because they rely on source manuscripts not then accessible to ( or not then highly regarded by ) early 17th - century Biblical scholarship . In the Old Testament , there are also many differences from modern translations that are based not on manuscript differences , but on a different understanding of Ancient Hebrew vocabulary or grammar by the translators . For example , in modern translations it is clear that Job 28 : 1 -- 11 is referring throughout to mining operations , which is not at all apparent from the text of the Authorized Version . Mistranslations ( edit ) The King James version contains several mistranslations ; especially in the Old Testament where the knowledge of Hebrew and cognate languages was uncertain at the time . Most of these are minor and do not significantly change the meaning compared to the source material . Among the most commonly cited errors is in the Hebrew of Job and Deuteronomy , where רֶאֵם `` Re'em '' with the probable meaning of `` wild - ox , aurochs '' , is translated in the KJV as `` unicorn '' ; following in this the Vulgate unicornis and several medieval rabbinic commentators . The translators of the KJV note the alternative rendering , `` rhinocerots '' ( sic ) in the margin at Isaiah 34 : 7 . On a similar note Martin Luther 's German translation had also relied on the Vulgate Latin on this point , consistently translating רֶאֵם using the German word for unicorn , `` Einhorn . '' Otherwise , the translators on several occasions mistakenly interpreted a Hebrew descriptive phrase as a proper name ( or vice versa ) ; as at 2 Samuel 1 : 18 where ' the Book of Jasher ' סֵפֶר הַיׇּשׇׁר properly refers not to a work by an author of that name , but should rather be rendered as `` the Book of the Upright . '' Influence ( edit ) Despite royal patronage and encouragement , there was never any overt mandate to use the new translation . It was not until 1661 that the Authorized Version replaced the Bishops Bible in the Epistle and Gospel lessons of the Book of Common Prayer , and it never did replace the older translation in the Psalter . In 1763 The Critical Review complained that `` many false interpretations , ambiguous phrases , obsolete words and indelicate expressions ... excite the derision of the scorner '' . Blayney 's 1769 version , with its revised spelling and punctuation , helped change the public perception of the Authorized Version to a masterpiece of the English language . By the 19th century , F.W. Faber could say of the translation , `` It lives on the ear , like music that can never be forgotten , like the sound of church bells , which the convert hardly knows how he can forego . '' The Authorized Version has been called `` the most influential version of the most influential book in the world , in what is now its most influential language '' , `` the most important book in English religion and culture '' , and `` the most celebrated book in the English - speaking world '' . David Crystal has estimated that it is responsible for 257 idioms in English , examples include feet of clay and reap the whirlwind . Furthermore , prominent atheist figures such as the late Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins have praised the King James Version as being `` a giant step in the maturing of English literature '' and `` a great work of literature '' , respectively , with Dawkins then adding , `` A native speaker of English who has never read a word of the King James Bible is verging on the barbarian '' . Although the Authorized Version 's former monopoly in the English - speaking world has diminished -- for example , the Church of England recommends six other versions in addition to it -- it is still the most used translation in the United States , especially as the Scofield Reference Bible for Evangelicals . In addition , in the Orthodox Church in America , the King James Version is used liturgically , and was made `` the ' official ' translation for a whole generation of American Orthodox '' . The later Service Book of the Antiochian Archdiocese , in vogue today , also uses the King James Version . The King James Version is also one of the versions authorized to be used in the services of the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Communion , as it is the historical Bible of this Church . Copyright status ( edit ) The Authorized Version is in the public domain in most of the world . However , in the United Kingdom , the right to print , publish and distribute it is a Royal prerogative and the Crown licenses publishers to reproduce it under letters patent . In England , Wales and Northern Ireland the letters patent are held by the Queen 's Printer , and in Scotland by the Scottish Bible Board . The office of Queen 's Printer has been associated with the right to reproduce the Bible for centuries , the earliest known reference coming in 1577 . In the 18th century all surviving interests in the monopoly were bought out by John Baskett . The Baskett rights descended through a number of printers and , in England , Wales and Northern Ireland , the Queen 's Printer is now Cambridge University Press , who inherited the right when they took over the firm of Eyre & Spottiswoode in 1990 . Other royal charters of similar antiquity grant Cambridge University Press and Oxford University Press the right to produce the Authorized Version independently of the Queen 's Printer . In Scotland the Authorized Version is published by Collins under licence from the Scottish Bible Board . The terms of the letters patent prohibit any other than the holders , or those authorized by the holders , from printing , publishing or importing the Authorized Version into the United Kingdom . The protection that the Authorized Version , and also the Book of Common Prayer , enjoy is the last remnant of the time when the Crown held a monopoly over all printing and publishing in the United Kingdom . Almost all provisions granting copyright in perpetuity were abolished by the Copyright , Designs and Patents Act 1988 , but because the Authorized Version is protected by royal prerogative rather than copyright , it will remain protected , as specified in CDPA s171 ( 1 ) ( b ) . Permission ( edit ) Cambridge University Press permits the reproduction of at most 500 verses for `` liturgical and non-commercial educational use '' if their prescribed acknowledgement is included , the quoted verses do not exceed 25 % of the publication quoting them and do not include a complete Bible book . For use beyond this , the Press is willing to consider permission requested on a case - by - case basis and in 2011 a spokesman said the Press generally does not charge a fee but tries to ensure that a reputable source text is used . Apocrypha ( edit ) Further information on the Apocrypha : Biblical canon Translations of the books of the Biblical apocrypha were necessary for the King James version , as readings from these books were included in the daily Old Testament lectionary of the Book of Common Prayer . Protestant Bibles in the 16th century included the books of the Apocrypha -- generally , following the Luther Bible , in a separate section between the Old and New Testaments to indicate they were not considered part of the Old Testament text -- and there is evidence that these were widely read as popular literature , especially in Puritan circles ; The Apocrypha of the King James Version has the same 14 books as had been found in the Apocrypha of the Bishop 's Bible ; however , following the practice of the Geneva Bible , the first two books of the Apocrypha were renamed 1 Esdras and 2 Esdras , as compared to the names in the Thirty - nine Articles , with the corresponding Old Testament books being renamed Ezra and Nehemiah . Starting in 1630 , volumes of the Geneva Bible were occasionally bound with the pages of the Apocrypha section excluded . In 1644 the Long Parliament forbade the reading of the Apocrypha in Church and in 1666 the first editions of the King James Bible without the Apocrypha were bound . The standardization of the text of the Authorized Version after 1769 together with the technological development of stereotype printing made it possible to produce Bibles in large print - runs at very low unit prices . For commercial and charitable publishers , editions of the Authorized Version without the Apocrypha reduced the cost , while having increased market appeal to non-Anglican Protestant readers . With the rise of the Bible societies , most editions have omitted the whole section of Apocryphal books . The British and Foreign Bible Society withdrew subsidies for bible printing and dissemination in 1826 , under the following resolution : That the funds of the Society be applied to the printing and circulation of the Canonical Books of Scripture , to the exclusion of those Books and parts of Books usually termed Apocryphal ; The American Bible Society adopted a similar policy . Both societies eventually reversed these policies in light of 20th - century ecumenical efforts on translations , the ABS doing so in 1964 and the BFBS in 1966 . King James only movement ( edit ) Main article : King James Only movement The King James Only movement advocates the superiority of the King James Version over all other English translations . Most adherents of the movement believe that the Textus Receptus is very close , if not identical , to the original autographs thereby making it the ideal Greek source for the translation . They argue that most modern English translations are based on a corrupted New Testament text that relies primarily on the Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus manuscripts . One of them , Perry Demopoulos , was a director of translating of King James Bible into Russian . In 2010 New Testament of Russian KJV was released in Kiev , Ukraine . In 2017 1st edition of whole Bible was released .

Unfortunately , both Orloff and Hapgood used a different version for the Psalms ( that of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer ) , thereby giving us two translations in the same services . This was rectified in 1949 by the Service Book of the Antiochian Archdiocese , which replaced the Prayer Book psalms with those from the King James Version and made some other corrections . This beautiful translation , reproducing the stately prose of 1611 , was the work of Fathers Upson and Nicholas .

The adaptation , originally intended as a play , was filmed in Quebec on a small budget , with effects depicting the death of a person and an animal .

Lester was a poet and the two recently moved from England , where he leased the house for three years . Frank Hallet , the adult son of landlord Cora Hallet , visits and makes sexual advances toward Rynn . Cora Hallet later arrives at the house , searching for Rynn 's father . Rynn claims he is in New York and taunts the landlord about her son . The situation becomes more tense when Mrs. Hallet insists on retrieving her jelly glasses from the cellar . Rynn steadfastly refuses to let her in the cellar , and Mrs. Hallet leaves . She returns later , and , ignoring Rynn 's warnings , opens the trapdoor to go into the cellar . Suddenly terrified by something she sees , Mrs. Hallet attempts to flee but accidentally knocks down the cellar door support , fatally hitting her head on the door . Trying to hide evidence of Mrs. Hallet 's visit , Rynn goes outside to move her car . Her inability to start it attracts the attention of Mario , a young magician and the nephew of Officer Miglioriti . Mario helps her move the car , and they have dinner together at Rynn 's house . Miglioriti stops by to tell them that Frank Hallet has reported his mother missing , and asks to see Rynn 's father , but Mario covers by saying that her father has gone to bed . Later that night , Frank Hallet makes a surprise visit . Suspicious and looking for answers about the whereabouts of his mother and Rynn 's father , he tries to scare Rynn into talking by killing her pet hamster . Mario chases Frank away , and Rynn now trusts him enough to show him her secret . Her terminally ill father and abusive mother divorced long ago . To protect Rynn from being returned to her mother 's custody after his death , he moved them to an isolated area and made plans to allow Rynn to live alone , then committed suicide in the ocean so his body would not be found . He also left Rynn with a jar of potassium cyanide , telling her that it was a sedative , to give to her mother if she ever came for her . Rynn coolly recounts how she put the powder in her mother 's tea and watched her die . She learned embalming at the library in order to hide the body in the cellar . The trust between Rynn and Mario blossoms into romance . It starts to rain heavily , and Mario catches a cold . Miglioriti , suspicious of Rynn 's excuses for her father 's absence , again returns to the house . When he asks to see her father , Mario , disguised as an old man , comes down the stairs and introduces himself as Lester Jacobs . After winter sets in , Rynn learns that Mario 's cold has developed into pneumonia and he is in the hospital . Rynn comes to see him , but he is unconscious , and she feels lonelier than ever before . That night , as Rynn is going to bed , she is shocked to find Frank coming out of the cellar . Having put the pieces together and knowing the truth about Rynn 's parents , he attempts to blackmail her by offering to protect her secrets in exchange for sexual favours . Rynn , seemingly defeated and resigned to Frank 's demands , agrees to his suggestion that they have a cup of tea . Rynn places a dose of the potassium cyanide into her own cup and then takes the tea and almond cookies to the living room . A suspicious Frank switches his cup with hers , and Rynn watches on as he begins to succumb to the poison . Cast ( edit ) Martin Sheen has a major role as Frank Hallet . Jodie Foster as Rynn Jacobs Martin Sheen as Frank Hallet Alexis Smith as Mrs. Hallet Mort Shuman as Officer Miglioriti Scott Jacoby as Mario Themes ( edit ) Felicia Feaster , writing for Turner Classic Movies , found an `` unusual theme '' in the film , which she interpreted as being one of independence for children . Professor James R. Kincaid read the film as a call for children 's rights . T.S. Kord wrote the film argued that a child with money and a home does not need a parent if he or she does not believe it is necessary . The adults who attempt to intrude in Rynn 's affairs are a threat , including her mother , her landlord , and the molester . Writer Anthony Synnott placed The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane in a trend of sexualizing children in film , calling Rynn the `` murdering nymphet '' and comparing her to Foster 's child prostitute character Iris in Taxi Driver ( 1976 ) . Anthony Cortese also referred to Foster as giving an `` encore performance '' of Taxi Driver , calling Rynn `` a 13 - year - old imp of maturing sexuality '' . Scholar Andrew Scahill described it as fitting a cinematic narrative of children in rebellion , one in which the child appears seemly , as with The Innocents ( 1961 ) , The Omen ( 1976 ) and others . The genre has been debated , with Feaster arguing it was more psychological thriller than horror . Jim Cullen summed the film up as `` a strange hybrid '' of genres , being a horror , thriller and feminist film . Kord listed it among dramas about `` Eerie , malevolent or criminal children '' , distinct from depictions of children in the supernatural horror genre . Martin Sheen said it was a horror film in some ways , but `` not overt '' , with mystery and suspense elements . However , director Nicolas Gessner denied it was horror , characterizing it as `` a teenage love story '' . Production ( edit ) Development ( edit ) Novelist Laird Koenig adapted his book himself . Originally , the script was intended as a play , but this idea was abandoned due to the belief that a young woman would not be available to play Rynn for an extended period . Gessner read the book , only to find rights were optioned to Sam Spiegel , but the project was derailed due to creative differences , allowing Gessner to secure them . The film followed tax incentives for cinema offered by the government of Canada , beginning in 1974 , stimulating a `` Hollywood North '' . It was a co-production of Canada and France , with Zev Braun producing as head of Zev Braun Productions , based in Los Angeles , alongside L.C.L. Industries in Montreal and Filmedis - Filmel in Paris . Canadian producer Denis Héroux , who during the decade specialized in popular cinema with financiers from outside the country , also worked on the project . It was shot on a small budget . Financiers disliked how in the novel , Rynn murdered Mrs. Hallet with poisonous gas , causing the scene to be rewritten so the death is accidental . Casting ( edit ) Director Martin Scorsese was editing Alice Does n't Live Here Anymore , and Gessner 's look at his work led him to discover Jodie Foster . With the guidance of her mother Brandy , Jodie took the role of Rynn , and turned 13 while the film was being shot . She wore a wig for the film , and a gap was added in her teeth . Sheen said he was contacted by Gessner personally about playing Frank Hallet , which Sheen accepted because he found the part intriguing and because he believed Foster had a promising career . Gessner claimed Sheen was initially more interested in playing Mario , but Gessner persuaded Sheen that he was too old for that part . Gessner noted that casting Alexis Smith , who was born in Canada , also helped secure Canadian tax incentives . Filming ( edit ) Knowlton , Quebec was a filming location . The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane was filmed in Montreal and Knowlton , Quebec . Sheen described the set as relaxed and as encouraging creativity , and said Foster also built a friendship with his daughter Renée Estevez during shooting . A producer 's desire for `` sex and violence '' led to a nude scene depicting Rynn to the film . Foster strongly objected , saying `` I walked off the set '' . As a result , her older sister Connie acted as the nude double . Her mother had suggested Connie , who was 21 at the time . Following the release of Taxi Driver , the industry shared stories of Foster having conflicts during the production of The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane . However , Gessner claimed Foster only regretted the scene after it was shot , and her request that it be deleted was denied by the Canadian producers . The crew built a false trapdoor for Mrs. Hallet 's death scene , though Gessner acknowledged Smith was nervous about the effect . For the scene where Frank Hallet kills the hamster Gordon , Sheen handled a dead and frozen rodent , and attempted to make it seem like it was still alive . Sound effects of squealing were also added . The dead hamster was obtained from a hospital which carried out animal research , while the live hamster portraying Gordon in other scenes was given to the costume designer after production . Music ( edit ) Chopin 's Piano Concerto No. 1 in E Minor Frédéric Chopin 's music is used in the film . Problems playing this file ? See media help . Mort Shuman , who played Officer Miglioriti , was a musician in real life , so the crew intended that Shuman would also write the film score . However , Shuman 's arranger Christian Gaubert wrote the bulk of the music , giving him the credit of composer , while Shuman was listed as the music supervisor . Gessner wanted to use the music of Polish composer and pianist Frédéric Chopin , finding his music a good match with the dialogue . He said Chopin 's music was intended to symbolize hope and absolution , along with sadness . Chopin 's piece No. 1 in E Minor was performed by pianist Claudio Arrau and The London Philharmonic Orchestra . Release ( edit ) After a screening at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1976 , Astral Bellevue Pathé Limited sold distribution rights to The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane , allowing it to make $750,000 worldwide by June . The film was shown in Paris with a French dub on 26 January and in Toronto on 28 January 1977 . According to Variety , Beachfront Properties secured a temporary restraining order which gave it ownership of the film per a contract from September 1976 . This order forbade any new sales but would not change the American International Pictures scheduled April 1977 release . The film had trial screenings in Albuquerque and Peoria , Illinois on 18 March 1977 . It opened in Los Angeles on 11 May and in New York City on 10 August 1977 , with a PG rating . On its initial release , the film poster depicted The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane as a horror film , with an image of a building evoking the 1960 film Psycho and the subtitle `` Where is her mother ? Where is her father ? Where are all the people who went to visit her ? What is her unspeakable secret ? ... Everyone who knows is dead . '' A VHS release of the film removed the nudity , but it was re-added to the DVD . StudioCanal published a DVD in Region 2 on 20 October 2008 . Kino Lorber released the film on Blu - ray in Region A on 10 May 2016 . Hulu and Amazon Prime also made the film available to their customers in November 2016 . Reception ( edit ) Critical reception ( edit ) Janet Maslin , writing for The New York Times , said this was Foster 's most natural portrayal of a child and that Sheen was frightening , and found the romance to be the greatest strength . In The Washington Post , Gary Arnold called the film engaging , but claimed the murder plot is `` too glib , too imorally contrived , to be satisfying . '' Variety 's review stated the story was unbelievable , and the romance was one of the few positive aspects . Time 's Christopher Porterfield felt the film failed to address the most interesting mysteries , and that doing so , combined with Foster 's acting , would have made the film memorable . Judith Crist 's New York Post review judged it to be `` a better - than - average thriller '' . Foster 's biographer Louis Chunovic referred to the film as `` much maligned '' . Felicia Feaster of TCM remarked that The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane became a cult film , noting Danny Peary profiled it in his Guide for the Film Fanatic . Peary also listed it in his book Cult Horror Movies . In 1992 , James Monaco gave the film three and a half stars , assessing it as disturbing and complimenting the performances and writing . In their DVD and Video Guide 2005 , Mick Martin and Marsha Porter awarded it three and a half stars , commenting it was `` remarkably subdued '' . Author David Greven praised Foster for a performance `` achingly '' suggesting `` adolescent anomie '' . In his 2015 Movie Guide , Leonard Maltin gave the film three stars , declaring it as a `` Complex , unique mystery '' . The film has a 90 % approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes , based on 10 reviews .

She first appeared in the show 's pilot , `` Our Very First Show '' , which aired in 1987 , and continued to appear throughout up to the two - part series finale , `` Michelle Rides Again '' in 1995 . The character of Michelle was the Olsen twins ' first acting role ; the two were infants when they started working on the series . Contents ( hide ) 1 Character 1.1 Friendships 2 Comet the dog 3 Crediting 4 Reception 5 Book series 6 Fuller House 7 References 8 External links Character ( edit ) Michelle Tanner is the youngest member of the Tanner family , and is notable in the series for saying a string of precocious catchphrases such as `` you got it dude '' , `` you 're in big trouble , mister '' , `` no way , José ! '' and `` aw nuts ! '' . Raised by her father Danny Tanner , her uncle Jesse Katsopolis , and her father 's friend Joey Gladstone after her mother Pam 's death in a car accident caused by a drunk driver , Michelle debuted during her character 's infancy , maturing throughout the progression of the series . She is depicted as being slightly mischievous , though her status as the youngest daughter of the family leaves many of her misdeeds undisciplined and spares her from punishment -- much to the chagrin of her older sisters . Michelle is quite playful , being a young child ; however many episodes end with her realization of a vital moral . Having never interacted with her deceased mother , Michelle occasionally yearns for a mother of her own , and episode plots have surrounded her desire for a mother and her plans to attempt to gain one through her father Danny remarrying . She forms a very strong familial bond with Jesse and enjoys his company and playful teasing . She was the flower girl at his and Becky 's wedding . Their relationship is so strong that she becomes crestfallen upon learning of Jesse 's intended relocation from the Tanner household after his marriage to Rebecca Donaldson in the season four episode `` Fuller House '' . She holds a tendency to scheme when met with a new desire as an enhancement to the comedy of the series , but she eventually realizes the errors of her ways by the episode 's conclusion . From seasons six through eight ( as first established in `` Lovers and Other Tanners '' ) , Michelle is a `` Honey Bee '' in an organization which her sisters D.J. and Stephanie had previously participated in . Michelle attends Meadowcrest Preschool through seasons 3 - 4 and later , Frasier Street Elementary School through seasons 5 - 8 . Friendships ( edit ) In the season three episode `` Bye , Bye Birdie '' , on Michelle 's first day of preschool , she meets a boy named Aaron Bailey , who , that day , is able to wear the sharing crown because he brought his toys in . That day , the teacher calls the kids to the reading carpet for storytime and Michelle tells the class bird to come to participate , opening the cage and consequently resulting in the bird flying out the open window . A saddened Michelle tries desperately to get the bird back , but at the end of the episode , Danny gets her a new bird for her class . When she brings it in , all the kids love it , and Aaron lets Michelle wear the sharing crown for bringing the bird to be the class pet ; the two eventually become friends and stay friends throughout the series . In seasons five and six , she is friends with a boy named Teddy , whom she meets on her first day of kindergarten in the season five premiere `` Double Trouble '' . The two enjoy doing many things together ; it is revealed in `` The Long Goodbye '' that they enjoy dotting each other 's `` I '' 's on their papers . When the two are in first grade , Teddy reveals his father got a new job and thus he and his family have to move to Amarillo , Texas . Michelle , saddened by the news , ties him up in her room tricking him into thinking she was teaching him how to jump rope . He is eventually untied by Joey and he gives her his special toy , `` Furry Murray '' and she gives him her special stuffed pig , `` Pinky . '' Later , the two decide to write to one another . At the end of that same episode , Michelle makes a new friend named Denise Frazier , who then sits in Teddy 's old seat and learns how to cross `` T '' 's . The two become friends through the seventh season ( Denise does not appear in season eight due to her portrayer Jurnee Smollett 's commitment to the short - lived sitcom On Our Own ) . She , at first , does not want a new best friend , but she does like Denise . Michelle also makes many other friends throughout the series , including shy but intelligent Derek Boyd ( Blake McIver Ewing ) and tough - girl Lisa Leeper ( Kathryn Zaremba ) . In the season seven episode `` Be Your Own Best Friend , '' Teddy moves back to San Francisco and attends Michelle 's school once again , rejoining her class . Michelle , Teddy , and Denise get into an argument when Danny comes into class for Parent Volunteer Day . He gives an assignment to trace each student 's best friend , leading Michelle to believe that a person could only have one best friend . The three then have trouble deciding who to trace , allowing Michelle to take advantage of the situation . She says that she would pick the one who gives her the best stuff , but she did not say it explicitly ( Teddy offers to give her his lone - star bolo tie and some Snickles candy -- a parody of Skittles , and Denise offers her hair scrunchie and pencil case ; Michelle takes them up on the offers , not realizing she is accepting bribes , which ultimately make Teddy and Denise angry when they understand what is actually happening ) . The three eventually make up in the end after Michelle picks Comet the dog as her best friend and traces him , and Danny helps them to understand that they could all be best friends . Comet the dog ( edit ) In the season three episode `` And They Call It Puppy Love , '' the Tanner family adopts a dog named Comet , one of the puppies born to Minnie , a golden retriever who wandered from the home of her owners halfway across the country to California and was found by D.J. and Stephanie . Michelle grows a strong bond with Comet over the course of the series . In the season four episode `` One Last Kiss , '' Michelle wanted another dog that was her size because Comet got bigger . In the season six episode `` Road to Tokyo , '' when Jesse is on tour in Tokyo , Michelle decides to dig a hole to Tokyo in order to visit and she asks Comet to dig . In the season eight episode `` Comet 's Excellent Adventure , '' Comet runs away when Jesse unknowingly gives her permission to walk Comet by herself ( as he was trying to deal with his bandmates in Jesse and the Rippers voting him out of the group due to the intrusion of his commitments to the family and his radio show gig ) , leading Michelle ( and eventually , the rest of the family ) to look all around San Francisco to find him ( it was the only episode of the series that was filmed on location in San Francisco ) . Comet comes home at the end of the episode . Crediting ( edit ) The production team behind Full House did not want people to know that Michelle was played by a set of twins , so the girls were credited as `` Mary - Kate Ashley Olsen '' for most of the show 's run ( making it appear as if a single actress had the first name Mary - Kate and the middle name Ashley ) . Although the two were credited separately as `` Mary - Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen '' during the closing credits in the series ' first season ( they were not officially added to the opening title sequence until season two but were credited in the syndicated versions of the season one opening titles ) , it was not until the eighth and final season that the twins were credited as `` Mary - Kate and Ashley Olsen '' in the opening titles . Despite the fact that the Olsens are fraternal twins , their physical appearances were nonetheless similar enough so that few could tell the difference between the two over the course of the show 's run . In season one , Mary - Kate was used more often due to the fact Ashley cried when she was put on set for a scene . Reception ( edit ) In 1989 , Mary - Kate and Ashley Olsen won a Young Artist Award for Best Young Actor / Actress Under Five Years of Age for their portrayal of Michelle . In 1990 , they were also awarded Young Artist Awards for their work on Full House , in the category of Outstanding Performance by an Actress Under Nine Years of Age . The two also won the Young Artist Awards for Exceptional Performance by a Young Actress Under Ten in 1991 . Book series ( edit ) Shortly after the show ended , two separate book series focusing respectively on Michelle and Stephanie were published . The stories take place mainly during the continuity of the show 's later seasons , and include the sisters ' friends and many other characters . The plots mainly focus on the characters ' struggles and triumphs . Most of the books were not an episode in the series . Michelle is about nine years old and Stephanie is in her teens in the series . The books were mainly published in the 1990s . Fuller House ( edit ) The twins declined to reprise their role for Fuller House , the 2016 Netflix sequel to Full House . Ashley cited their 12 years away from acting and Mary - Kate said the timing was bad . In the series , their character is only seen during flashbacks and mentioned from time - to - time . For example , they mention that Michelle is now working as a fashion designer in New York .

Among the stars attending the service were Ray Romano and Patricia Heaton ( her co-stars from Everybody Loves Raymond ) and actor David Hyde Pierce . Romano said of Roberts , `` Doris Roberts had an energy and a spirit that amazed me . She never stopped . Whether working professionally or with her many charities , or just nurturing and mentoring a green young comic trying to make it as an actor , she did everything with such a grand love for life and people and I will miss her dearly . '' In another interview Romano jokingly responded about the kissing thing that Roberts did off - camera : `` You know how great she was then ! '' He also added : `` We had a little get together for her . She was one of a kind . She can outwork it , outdrink it , good kisser , I was joking ! I appreciated her . '' Just a month after her death he added : `` Here 's how good she was : She played the most intrusive , overbearing , nosy woman -- always starting fights and whatnot and meddling in our business -- and yet when I asked the fans who their favorite character was , all the time it was her , '' said Romano , `` She was so good at portraying the love that was underneath . '' She was interred at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles , California .

( September 2013 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) King of the Hill is an American animated sitcom created by Mike Judge and Greg Daniels . The main characters are Hank Hill , Peggy Hill , Bobby Hill , Luanne Platter , Dale Gribble , Bill Dauterive , Boomhauer , Kahn Souphanousinphone , and Elroy `` Lucky '' Kleinschmidt . Contents ( hide ) 1 Main characters 2 Other Hill , Platter , and Kleinschmidt relatives 3 Other Gribbles 4 Other Dauterives 5 Other Boomhauers 6 Souphanousinphones 7 Strickland Propane 8 Tom Landry Middle School 9 Arlen VFW 10 Other recurring characters 11 Other characters 12 References 13 External links Main characters ( edit ) Hank Rutherford Hill ( voiced by Mike Judge ) -- Hank is the main protagonist who proudly sells `` propane and propane accessories '' as the assistant manager at Strickland Propane , and throughout the entire series always makes a big deal about the job when everybody around Hank finds his occupation boring . He resembles -- in both voice and appearance -- the Tom Anderson character from Beavis and Butthead , a character also voiced by Judge . Hank is generally a well - meaning father , but is often confused and anxious towards modern trends and the antics of his friends and family members . Hank suffers from a narrow urethra , which made Bobby 's conception difficult . Hank is uncomfortable with public displays of intimacy with his wife and son . He has a very difficult time saying `` I love you '' to any member of his family , as he thinks it is unmanly . Hank 's trademark wail of distress in times of discomfort ( sounding like `` Bwaaaah ! '' ) and his phrase `` I tell you what '' ( `` what '' in his dialect being pronounced / ˈhwʌt / ) are running gags on the series . Hank is a byproduct of a bygone era , nevertheless the qualities are principled ; ever faithful , friendly , firm , reasonable , well - read and hard working . Much of the series revolves around Hank 's desire to do the right thing compared to much of the rest of the people around him who would rather cheat , lie or exploit . Hank is a proud Texan , having grown up there . He was , however , born in a ladies room at Yankee Stadium , and spent the first three days of his life in New York City . Margaret `` Peggy '' J. Platter Hill ( voiced by Kathy Najimy ) -- Hank 's wife , Peggy ( née Platter ) , was born in Montana and raised on her family 's cattle ranch . Her strained relationship with her mother is a source of drama for her . Peggy is a substitute teacher in Arlen , Texas , specializing in teaching Spanish despite having a poor grasp of the language . Peggy is also a freelance newspaper columnist , notary public , an exemplary softball pitcher and a Boggle champion and has started a career in real estate . She has a habit of adding or changing ingredients to ordinary dishes then naming them after herself . `` SpaPeggy & Meatballs '' and `` Apple Brown Peggy '' are examples . Peggy is very self - conscious about her larger - than - normal feet ( size 16 1⁄2 on the left , 16 on the right ) . Despite boasting of her intelligence , she has been the victim of manipulation , such as being conned out of $2,500 for a phony degree , indoctrinated into a homogenous cult , and tricked into a pyramid scheme selling Herbalife inspired products . She has brown hair and typically wears glasses , an aquamarine sleeveless shirt , and denim culottes , but often wears different outfits . Though she claims to be bilingual , her grasp in the Spanish language is only basic . Robert Jeffrey `` Bobby '' Hill ( voiced by Pamela Adlon ) -- Hank and Peggy 's husky 13 - year - old son and best friend to Joseph and Connie . Although friendly , gentle , lovable , and generally well - liked , he is n't very bright and often prone to making bad decisions . He wants to be a famous prop comic and move to New York when he is older . Bobby displays little interest in gender roles and , although superb at golf and target shooting , dislikes team sports , often taking such classes as Home Economics and Peer Counseling , instead of more traditionally `` masculine classes '' . Although many ( including Hank ) tend to typify him as `` not right '' , he is romantically successful , dating Connie and other girls throughout the series . Dale Alvin Gribble A.K.A. `` Rusty Shackleford '' ( voiced by Johnny Hardwick ) -- Dale is the Hills ' chain - smoking neighbor who is also an insect exterminator among various self - appointed occupations . His physical appearance was modeled after Hunter S. Thompson . His greatest expertise lies in his knowledge of conspiracy theories and loopholes . Dale is paranoid about any government activity and frequently uses the alias of Rusty Shackleford to operate anonymously including having received unemployment payments from said alias . Dale is the president of the Arlen gun club and a licensed bounty hunter . He possesses a vast collection of guns from pistols to automatic weapons and is an ardent defender of Second Amendment rights . Despite being a firearms aficionado , his aim is relatively poor and despite being knowledgeable in military matters , he 's physically the weakest of the main cast and is an abject physical coward . He is an avid UFOlogist . Dale remains oblivious to the fact that his wife , Nancy , has cheated on him with John Redcorn for fourteen years and his son Joseph is not actually his biological son . Everyone else knows but chooses not to tell him because of his total obliviousness , the loving , trusting relationship he has with Joseph and Nancy , and the fact that Dale is more of a father to Joseph than John Redcorn is , although it is implied in one of the last scenes of the final episode that Dale found out somehow and is rather unconcerned , leading to the possibility he either knew all along , Nancy told him , or he found out through other means . Hank considers Dale a close friend , but he often becomes very annoyed with his schemes and conspiracies . Sgt . William `` Bill '' Fontaine Delatour Dauterive ( voiced by Stephen Root ) -- Bill is the Hills ' overweight , divorced , clinically depressed neighbor . He grew up in Louisiana with his cousin Gilbert and speaks French and English . He was formerly a rugged and attractive star lineman on Arlen High 's football team , nicknamed the `` Billdozer '' , and is now a sergeant barber in the United States Army . While his job mostly consists of shaving recruits , he is in fact an extremely talented barber able to replicate Hank 's signature flattop when his barber he had known for 20 years was becoming senile . Bill once had a bright future in the Army wanting to be a tanker , but ended up ruining his life after marrying the promiscuous Lenore . Bill is somewhat of a masochist and is often attracted to people who abuse him ; after suffering under his father and Lenore , Bill has an almost complete lack of self - worth . He obsesses about his ex-wife , and his loneliness is a running gag on the series . He frequently tries to flirt with and win over Peggy . Despite coming across as a loser , however , Bill has enjoyed several romantic successes ( or near - successes ) , including Kahn 's and Luanne 's mothers , former Texas governor Ann Richards , and the young widows of two of his dead cousins . He is named after executive producer and writer Jim Dauterive . Jeff Boomhauer ( voiced by Mike Judge ) -- Boomhauer is a slim womanizer whose mutterings are hard to understand to the audience but easily understood by his friends . A running joke is when his friends fail to understand him for some reason other than his incoherence . His speech is usually heavily littered with the phrases , `` dang '' and `` dang ol ' '' . Boomhauer can mumble his words , but he sings clearly and speaks other languages clearly ( mainly French and Spanish ) . Boomhauer is a classic - car aficionado and owns a 1969 Dodge Coronet Super Bee ( in high school he owned a late 1960s Ford Mustang nicknamed `` Ms. Sally '' ) , and , despite his incoherent ramblings and womanizing , often displays himself to be more intelligent and philosophical than his three friends . Although hinted at previously , in episode 18 of season 13 , his first name is finally revealed when a Canadian woman who lives next door to the family who trades houses with him for the summer calls him `` Jeff '' , and the driver 's license shown in the series finale reads `` Boomhauer , Jeff '' . Throughout the series it is never known what he does for a living , although it was revealed in an early episode that he was an electrical engineer but was on workers compensation . At the end of the series finale , a badge seen in his open wallet reveals that he is a Texas Ranger . Luanne Leanne Platter Kleinschmidt ( voiced by Brittany Murphy ) -- Luanne ( née Platter ) is the Hills ' college - age niece , daughter of Peggy 's scheming paternal twin brother Hoyt and his alcoholic ex-wife Leanne . Luanne moves in with the Hills after her mother Leanne stabs Hoyt with a fork during a drunken fight which tips over their trailer . Hank initially makes frequent attempts to encourage Luanne to move out on her own , but later more - or-less accepts her as a member of the family . She was a student at the beauty academy and later at Arlen Community College . She was often portrayed as an airhead , but was shown to be an expert mechanic in the first two seasons and is good at logic puzzles . Luanne was promiscuous , but she settles down after being visited by the spirit of her first boyfriend , the slacker Buckley , whom she calls `` Buckley 's angel '' ; and then attending a church - sponsored `` born - again virgin '' program and starts a Bible study class . Luanne created a puppet show entitled `` The Manger Babies '' for a Public - access television cable TV station , featuring the barnyard animals who witnessed Christ 's birth ( though they included a penguin and an octopus ) . In the 10th season finale , Luanne revealed that she was pregnant with the child of Lucky , whom she married in the 11th season finale . In the 13th and final season , she has a baby girl named Gracie Margaret Kleinschmidt . She wears a green sleeveless shirt and red capris . Other Hill , Platter , and Kleinschmidt relatives ( edit ) Ladybird Hill -- The Hills ' thirteen - year - old purebred Georgia Bloodhound named after the First Lady of the United States Lady Bird Johnson . It 's said that her mother helped track down James Earl Ray , as revealed by Hank in episode 7 of season 1 titled `` Westie Side Story '' . Her companionship temporarily relieved Hank 's stress ( and narrow urethra ) , allowing him to impregnate Peggy . Later on in the series Ladybird would become deaf and despite much effort on Hank 's part , would never bear puppies because of her narrow uterus . Col. Cotton Lyndal Hill ( voiced by Toby Huss ) -- Hank 's cantankerous father , with a hair - trigger temper . Despite his many shortcomings , he occasionally showed a softer side , for example in the episode `` Cotton 's Plot '' where he helped Peggy learn to walk again after her parachuting accident . His shins were blown off in World War II by a `` Japan man 's machine gun '' and his feet were reattached to his knees , resulting in a short height and stilted gait . Despite his disability , he eventually reached the rank of colonel in the state militia . After Cotton and his first wife Tillie , Hank 's mother , divorced , he married a much younger , soft - spoken , busty blonde candy striper named Didi who gave birth to his youngest son `` G.H. '' ( `` Good Hank '' ) . He was immensely proud of his military service . Though his claim of fighting `` nazzies '' ( Nazis ) was proven false and his claim of killing `` fitty ( fifty ) men '' was dubious , his participation in several of the bloodiest battles in the Pacific Theater was confirmed and his uniform was shown to be decorated with the Medal of Honor and the Purple Heart . Cotton himself died in episode # 1218 , `` Death Picks Cotton '' , after suffering severe burns and an allergic reaction to shrimp during a flashback at a Japanese restaurant . Didi Hill ( voiced by Ashley Gardner ) -- Didi is Cotton 's second wife and a candy striper after she retired from being an exotic dancer . She has breast implants and suffers from postpartum depression following the birth of Cotton 's third son `` G.H. '' She is generally depicted as docile and unintelligent , although she is a certified optometry assistant . She was absent at the time of Cotton 's death and was only seen once more , where she says she is engaged and will remarry . Didi was a classmate of Hank 's in Kindergarten ( indicating they are the same age ) . Good Hank Jeffrey `` G.H. '' Hill -- G.H. is Cotton 's and Didi 's infant son , and the younger of Hank 's two half - brothers . G.H. is an abbreviation for `` Good Hank , '' implying that the original Hank was unsatisfactory to his father . Cotton treats G.H. much better than Hank presumably because Cotton sees him as being his second chance of being a better father than he was for Hank . G.H. was key at a time when Hank had to convince Cotton not to end his life as well as to permit Hank to give his father money for the baby 's sake ( and as payback for the years Cotton raised him ) . G.H. was absent at the time of his father 's death , and is not seen throughout the rest of the series , although it is presumed he is living with his mother and stepfather . Matilda `` Tillie '' Mae Hill Garrison ( voiced by Tammy Wynette in 1997 -- 1998 , Beth Grant in 1999 , and K Callan in 2000 -- 2009 ) -- Tillie is Cotton 's first wife and Hank 's mother . She divorced Cotton after suffering years of verbal abuse . Tillie is a kind woman who collects miniatures because they made her happy during Cotton 's abuse . Hank is often over-protective of her , fearing she is too old and fragile to go out and do things on her own . Tillie lives in Arizona with her husband Chuck , having formerly lived with her Jewish boyfriend Gary ( voiced by Carl Reiner ) . Tillie 's legal name varies during the series . She is listed as `` Tillie '' on Hank 's birth certificate , but is addressed as Matilda by the clergyman during her wedding to Chuck . Elroy `` Lucky '' Kleinschmidt ( voiced by Tom Petty ) -- Lucky is Luanne 's itinerant , but generally benign redneck husband , and is the father of Luanne 's child . It is often hard for Lucky to hold down a job ( he has no credit or Social Security number ) . He lives on the remainder of the $53,000 `` settlement monies '' he received after `` slipping on pee - pee at the Costco '' having had a portion of his spine fused . He was nicknamed `` Lucky '' after the settlement windfall . After he spent a majority of his money customizing his truck , his finances dwindled down to nine thousand dollars but regained another $53,000 when an ambulance chasing lawyer paid off Lucky to avoid a lawsuit . Peggy tried very hard to break him and Luanne apart , but after Luanne 's pregnancy was revealed , she and Hank reconciled the two , giving them a shotgun wedding at Lucky 's request . He is also one of the guitarists for John Redcorn 's band `` Big Mountain Fudgecake '' . Although dimwitted in some aspects , Lucky has learned some facets such as basic math through life experience as opposed to formal education , and was astute enough to deduce that his father - in - law spent time in jail whereas Luanne believed the story that he works on an oil rig . He yearned to receive his GED but only to prove he was good enough to marry Luanne . Gracie Margaret Kleinschmidt -- Daughter of Lucky and Luanne . She was born in the season 13 episode `` Lucky See , Monkey Do '' . Luanne originally wanted to name her Lasagna ( stating that lasagna was their favorite food ) while under the influence of hospital analgesics , but choosing a more conventional name after she had recovered . Myrna Kleinschmidt ( voiced by Paget Brewster ) -- Myrna is Lucky 's sister , Luanne 's sister - in - law , Gracie 's aunt , and the main antagonist in `` Lucky See , Monkey Do '' . She is an intelligent , modern mother who only appears in the episode `` Lucky See , Monkey Do '' . She has two children , one son and one daughter ( Gracie 's paternal first cousins ) and raises them in strict accordance with contemporary parenting practices , something which leads her into a rivalry with Peggy , whose parenting skills are from older schools of thought , over how to assist Luanne as her pregnancy due date approaches . When Luanne goes into labor , Myrna commandeers the situation and insists that Luanne have a natural , drug - free water birth , but under Hank 's encouragement to think for themselves about how to raise their child , Luanne and Lucky opt for a hospital birth instead . Leanne Platter ( voiced by Pamela Adlon ) -- Leanne , Luanne 's violent alcoholic mother , was imprisoned for `` second - degree assaulting '' her husband in the back with a fork . Though she is often mentioned during the course of the series , she appears only in the episode `` Leanne 's Saga , '' visiting Luanne in Arlen after her release from prison and briefly being courted by Bill Dauterive . Hoyt Platter ( voiced by Johnny Knoxville ) -- Hoyt is Luanne 's father , Peggy 's twin brother and Leanne 's ex-husband . Despite Luanne 's beliefs , he never worked on an oil rig , but was in jail for most of Luanne 's life , with the oil rig story acting as a cover so Luanne would n't know her father was a convict . He appears in only one episode : `` Life : A Loser 's Manual '' . After being released from jail , Hoyt commits a robbery and tricks Lucky into taking the blame , but he eventually confesses and is sentenced to life in prison under a three - strikes law . The episode `` Leanne 's Saga '' reveals that Hoyt was planning on marrying a pharmacist girl before Leanne , then working as a stripper , entertained at his bachelor party . Maddy Platter ( voiced by Joanna Gleason ) -- Maddy Platter is Peggy 's and Hoyt 's mother and Bobby 's and Luanne 's grandmother . Mother Platter lives in Montana with her son Hoyt . She is an old - fashioned , tough - as - nails rancher type and loathes Peggy for deserting the family ranch and not marrying a local neighbor boy . Strangely , earlier episode flashbacks feature a totally different `` Peggy 's mother '' character , who is essentially an older version of Peggy - it is not made clear if one is her real mother and one is her stepmother , or if the `` Maddy '' mother character retconned the older version completely . Doc Platter -- Doc is Peggy 's father . He makes only a single major appearance when Peggy , Bobby and Hank visit the family ranch . He seems to be going somewhat senile and preachy , which Hank misinterprets as old - fashion Western - style wisdom . Junichiro ( voiced by David Carradine ) -- Junichiro is Hank 's elder half - Japanese half - brother who has lived in Japan all his life . Hank and Junichiro have the same father , due to Cotton 's affair with a Japanese nurse during his war days , and share many similarities in appearance and mannerisms ( this in spite of the fact that Hank actually shares more of his mother 's features ) ; one of these is that when he is shocked , like Hank , he yells `` BWAH ! '' Like Hank , Junichiro also has a narrow urethra and is an assistant manager at the company for which he works , making robots and robot accessories . Dusty Hill ( Himself ) -- The bassist / vocalist for the band ZZ Top and Hank 's cousin . In the episode `` Hank Gets Dusted , '' Cotton gives his prized Cadillac to Dusty without allowing Hank a chance to buy it . Dusty enters the car in a demolition derby in which it is badly damaged . Hank and Dusty make their peace after Dusty has the car repaired and installed at the Cadillac Ranch . Other gribbles ( edit ) Nancy Hicks - Gribble ( voiced by Ashley Gardner ) -- Nancy ( née Hicks ) is Dale 's wife , Joseph 's mother , and weather - girl - turned - anchor for local news station Channel 84 . She had a fourteen - year affair with John Redcorn , which produced her son , Joseph , although she eventually broke off the affair and became a faithful wife to Dale . Redcorn refused to come back to her out of respect for Dale . Her mother Bunny was similarly unfaithful to Nancy 's father , but did not reveal her own long - term affair until Nancy began suffering from stress - induced hair loss over her unresolved feelings for John Redcorn . Nancy is a former beauty queen , a fact which helped her get her job as a news anchor . Joseph John Gribble ( voiced by Brittany Murphy in 1997 - 2000 , Breckin Meyer in 2000 - 2009 ) -- Dale and Nancy 's 13 - year - old son and one of Bobby 's best friends . Despite Joseph 's obvious Native American features , his similarity in appearance to John Redcorn , and the fact that his middle name is `` John , '' neither he nor Dale is aware that Redcorn is his biological father ( Nancy refers to Dale having a `` Jamaican grandmother '' to explain Joseph 's dark complexion ) . Redcorn 's occasional and awkward attempts to get closer to Joseph ( against Nancy 's wishes ) lead Joseph to regard him as strange and creepy . Joseph starts out as an ordinary teen , but eventually grows weird and creepy -- not to mention dim - witted . Joseph begins to take after Dale more than John , Nancy or even any of his friends . Joseph has a half - sister named Kate ( by John Redcorn having another affair ) , who is very similar to Joseph in personality and interests but likewise does not realize that Redcorn is their father . Joseph is the only character of the series shown to physically mature , having grown six inches in height over the course of a summer , a more built physique , athletic prowess and having a deeper voice and a wispy mustache upon his reappearance . It is implied in the episode `` Spin the Choice '' , Nancy finally told Joseph the truth . Joseph and John Redcorn seem to now share a genuine relationship . Bug Gribble ( voiced by David Herman ) -- Bug is Dale 's father , who had been estranged from Dale for many years for kissing Nancy at her and Dale 's wedding reception . Bug is actually gay and had been flirting with a Filipino caterer instead , and , upon sensing Dale 's imminent entry into the room , attempted to hide his orientation from his son by grabbing and kissing ' the nearest thing in a dress ' . This misunderstanding , and Bug 's inability to reveal his true sexuality to Dale , resulted in their estrangement . When Dale and Nancy renew their wedding vows 20 years afterward , Nancy arranges to invite Bug , and Dale initially suspects his odd behavior and his having a `` partner '' of meaning that Bug is an undercover government agent , but finally accepts the truth upon seeing Bug and his partner share a devoted kiss . Bug 's appearance in `` My Own Private Rodeo '' retcons his appearance in earlier episodes , where he bears a near - identicality to present - day Dale . Other Dauterives ( edit ) Gilbert Fontaine Dauterive ( voiced by David Herman ) -- Gilbert ( pronounced `` zhil - BEAR '' ) is Bill 's cousin . Though at one point shown to live on the family estate with his aunt and cousin in a Louisiana bayou in `` A Beer Can Named Desire '' , he and Bill eventually wind up as the last two living Dauterives . It is strongly implied that he is gay , and he even hits on Buck Strickland when Buck attempts to capitalize on the Dauterive family 's traditional barbecue sauce recipe in `` Blood and Sauce '' . Esmé Dauterive ( voiced by Meryl Streep ) - Esmé was Bill and Gilbert 's aunt , and matriarch of the Dauterive clan . She expressed deep concern over the family 's ever - shrinking headcount , lamenting that `` the Dauterive blood is down to a trickle '' . She happily received Bill upon his return for a visit and was not displeased to see him and his cousins ' widows taking mutual interest . She is only seen in `` A Beer Can Named Desire '' ; it is later revealed that she had died after a fever . Violetta Dauterive ( voiced by Natalie Maines ) -- Violetta was Bill and Gilbert 's cousin . She lived on the family estate in Louisiana with Esmé , Gilbert , and Rose and Lily , the widows of two other Dauterive cousins . Upon Bill 's visit she , Rose , and Lily , all having been without male companionship for too long , vied for Bill 's affections and attempted to seduce him , even despite Violetta 's own blood relation to him . Like Esmé , she is only seen in `` A Beer Can Named Desire '' ; it is later revealed that she had died in her sleep . Lenore Dauterive ( voiced by Ellen Barkin ) -- Lenore is Bill 's mean - spirited ex-wife . She is mentioned frequently throughout the course of the series , but only appears twice -- once being when Bill and Bobby watch Bill 's wedding video .

Eric Dauterive ( voiced by Stephen Root ) -- Bill 's implicitly - deceased father , who was said to be an abusive man and a heavy drinker , and is largely responsible for Bill 's emotional instability . Among the abuses Bill recalls from his father are having been spanked every day between the ages of 9 and 16 , being called a girl and made to wear `` pretty , pretty dresses '' , and being locked in a rabbit hutch . Other Boomhauers ( edit ) Patch Boomhauer ( voiced by Brad Pitt ) -- Patch is Boomhauer 's sleazy , womanizing younger brother . He appears in `` Patch Boomhauer '' , apparently engaged to marry Boomhauer 's old flame , Katherine - much to Boomhauer 's mounting displeasure , as he himself has unresolved feelings for Katherine , and Patch 's continued philandering angers him for her sake . The wedding is later called off after Patch hires strippers for his bachelor party and frames Boomhauer for trying to break up the engagement . Patch makes a final cameo in `` Lucky 's Wedding Suit '' as one of the guests at Luanne and Lucky 's wedding . Patch , like Boomhauer , speaks in a fast - paced Southern gibberish . Dr. and Mrs. Boomhauer ( voiced by Mike Judge ) - Boomhauer 's parents . Mrs. Boomhauer is shown to speak like Boomhauer in `` Peggy 's Turtle Song '' . In `` Three Coaches and a Bobby '' , Boomhauer mentions that his parents had won the lottery and moved to Florida . `` Mee - Maw '' Boomhauer ( voiced by Mike Judge ) - Boomhauer 's elderly grandmother . She is seen in `` Dang Ol ' Love '' , when Boomhauer , infatuated with Marlene , goes to Mee - Maw to ask for a family - heirloom wedding ring as well as `` Lucky 's Wedding Suit '' , where she is seen sitting with the other guests as well as dancing with Patch for a brief moment . Mee - Maw speaks in the same characteristic gibberish that the rest of the Boomhauers share . Souphanousinphones ( edit ) Kohng Koy `` Kahn '' Souphanousinphone ( voiced by Toby Huss ) -- Kahn is Hank 's materialistic , Laotian next - door neighbor and main antagonist . `` Kahn '' is an anagram of `` Hank '' , and his surname is a play on the word `` sousaphone '' meant to look like a real Lao name . He believes he is better than his neighbors , often referring to them as `` hillbillies '' or `` rednecks . '' He frequently boasts of his superiority to the others and dreams of being far more successful than Ted Wassanasong . Despite his arrogant attitude , Kahn seeks approval and friendship from his down - to - earth neighbors , who are accepting and tolerant of his ways . He previously worked for a defense contractor that manufactured composite ceramic armor , but was fired for spilling company secrets . After a string of job failures ( due to his attitude ) he found a new job forcing him to commute . Upon recollection of the story of how Minh and Kahn met , it is revealed that he was a former rebel and playboy whom Minh chose over the straight - laced intellectual her father set her up with . In one episode , Kahn shows that he is a trained martial artist while getting into a fight with a few rednecks . In the episode `` Just Another Manic Kahn - Day '' , it is revealed that Kahn has bipolar disorder ( which was also mentioned in the earlier episode `` Lost in Myspace '' ) . It is revealed in the episode `` Three Days of the Kahndo '' that Kahn has a brother also living in the US with a family of his own . Minh Souphanousinphone ( voiced by Lauren Tom ) -- Kahn 's wife . Minh is a housewife who enjoys making rude comments about the neighbors , particularly Peggy . She sometimes has a snobbish attitude toward the neighbors , but in reality she is a more understanding parent and a better neighbor than Kahn . She 's a crack shot , with championship - level skills , and at one point joined Dale 's gun club , exerting a positive effect on its members . She is highly competitive , going so far as to cheat on The New York Times crossword puzzle . Like her husband , Minh grew up in Laos , where her father was a powerful general in the army who was not happy with her decision to marry Kahn . She once told Nancy Gribble that she did n't grow up oppressed , rather because of her father 's high ranking position in the army , she `` was peasants ' worse nightmare '' , pointing to being a bully in her youth . She once unsuccessfully tried to teach Bobby the Laotian language . Kahn `` Connie '' Souphanousinphone , Jr. ( voiced by Lauren Tom ) -- Connie is the American - born daughter of Kahn and Minh , and one of Bobby 's best friends and his ex-girlfriend . She is a violin player , `` A '' student , and general overachiever pressured by her mother and father , who hold her to very high standards . Though it is implied that she works hard because of her overbearing parents , in reality , she does it for herself . Connie is named after her egomaniacal father because he wanted a son . Doggie Kahn -- Doggie Kahn ( often referred to simply as `` Doggie '' ) is their West Highland White Terrier , who has the uncanny ability to turn backflips , and is a competitive dancer . He once ran away with Ladybird . His name is a play on `` Donkey Kong . '' Tid Pao Souphanousinphone ( voiced by Lucy Liu ) -- Tid Pao is Connie 's criminally - inclined cousin from Los Angeles and the main antagonist in `` Bad Girls , Bad Girls , Whatcha Gonna Do '' , who was sent to stay at Kahn 's for a semester because she stole drugs from a street gang . She attended Tom Landry Middle School in the meantime . She seduced Bobby and tricked him into creating a meth lab by pretending to help him with building a candy machine for his group science project , and persuaded him to steal propane tanks from Strickland Propane to complete it . Tid Pao was caught by Connie and she was sent away by Kahn to Wisconsin to work on her last uncle 's dairy farm at the end of the episode because of her criminally - inclined nature . There her uncle told her she was on her last chance as he was the last relative left in America . Any more trouble would see her shipped off to live with her grandmother in Laos . Laoma Souphanousinphone ( voiced by Amy Hill ) -- Laoma is Kahn 's mother and the only person on the show who addresses him by his full name . She is kind and hardworking and enjoys housekeeping . She is disliked by Minh because of her criticism of Minh 's housework skills . The status - conscious Kahn is horrified when Laoma , bored and unwanted by her daughter - in - law , becomes the Hills ' housemaid , and even more horrified when she begins a love affair with Bill Dauterive . Laoma has not been seen since her first episode , mainly because the creators nixed the original plan for her and Bill to become a regular couple , preferring for Bill to remain his usual single and miserable self . General Gum ( voiced by James Sie ) -- Usually referred to as `` The General , '' ( his full name is Gum Nga Hexumalayasabrath ) he appeared only in the episodes `` Pour Some Sugar on Kahn '' ( in which he visits the family ) and `` Father of the Bribe '' ( in which Minh recalls her courtship by Kahn ) . He is Minh 's father and greatly dislikes Kahn . He served under several Laotian dictators and was put on trial for war crimes at The Hague . Strickland Propane ( edit ) Buck Strickland ( voiced by Stephen Root ) -- Buck is the slightly overweight , balding , over-the - hill owner of Strickland Propane , and Hank 's boss . His physical appearance greatly resembles Lyndon Johnson , particularly his hairline , and he has a habit of hosting employee discussions in his bathroom -- a habit of Johnson . Originally hailing from Arkansas , Buck was historically known for his modest start in business and general business smarts . These attributes have since been worn away by life and been replaced with many habits which often come in the way of his business decisions . Buck is a compulsive gambler to the point where he will use company profits to continue gaming , even betting in underground events . Also like LBJ , Buck is a chauvinist , alcoholic , and adulterer . It is often implied that Hank reveres Buck and that , in Hank 's eyes , the two have a close relationship . Compared to Hank who is the ultimate model of a good employee , Buck 's vices require Hank to keep an extremely close eye . Buck refers to Hank as his `` Golden Goose '' implying Hank is the only reason his business remains afloat and thus he would never fire him . Hank has used the threat of quitting to capitulate Buck 's transition from things Hank found unsavory . His health is questionable as he has suffered numerous infarctions and has had several cardiovascular surgeries including valve replacements . Despite his less than desirable traits , he has an ethical side although he planted evidence on Hank for murder rather than let his wife be arrested . Joe Jack ( voiced by Toby Huss ) -- Joe Jack is a fuel - truck driver and co-worker with Hank at Strickland Propane . He has a drinking problem , as seen when he is a member of the Propaniacs . Joe Jack has a habit of calling people he speaks to `` honey '' , regardless of their gender or level of familiarity with him . Enrique ( voiced by Eloy Casados from 1997 -- 1998 , Danny Trejo from 2002 -- 2009 ) -- Enrique is a good - natured Mexican - American truck driver at Strickland Propane . Originally he spoke with a very weak accent . In the episode `` Enrique - cilable Differences , '' Enrique forcibly befriends Hank after a nasty fight with his wife . Enrique ends up moving in with the Hills for a short time eventually developing a pathological attachment to the Hill family , but quickly patches things up with his wife after a fed - up Hank kicks him out . Enrique nearly lost his house due to rent increases when property values in his neighborhood skyrocket when Peggy began selling working class housing to upper - middle class Millennials . To solve the problem , Peggy helped the neighborhood value decline when she fabricated the area as uncool by making it appear as if typical middle - class families were moving in prompting the millennials to leave . Afterwards he applied and became a homeowner . While a hard worker , he has poor fiscal habits , often spending money on lavish outdoor parties to celebrate any seemingly significant event such as his daughter 's Quinceañera or becoming a homeowner . Donna ( voiced by Pamela Adlon ) -- There are actually two separate Donnas who have both worked as Strickland accountants , and are often referred to as `` Donna from Accounting '' . The first Donna appears , albeit infrequently , as an overweight , dark - skinned woman , most notably in `` Meet the Propaniacs '' . In `` Are You There , God ? It 's Me , Margaret Hill '' , Buck mentions having discovered stolen office supplies in her bedroom ( presumably during an extramarital encounter ) , and orders Hank to `` find us a new Donna '' . The `` new Donna '' is a tall , curvy white woman who first appears in `` The Miseducation of Bobby Hill '' . In `` 24 Hour Propane People '' she mentions a husband ; in `` You Gotta Believe ( In Moderation ) '' , Dale notes her `` recent divorce '' . In `` Lost in MySpace '' , her most significant episode , she is briefly promoted to assistant manager alongside Hank , which did n't settle in well with him . She often uses MySpace during work hours and ignored Hank when he asked her for a down to business approach . In turn , Donna is briefly fired when some of her MySpace friends mistook Buck for Hank and brutally beat him up . She sought revenge against Hank by making rude comments about him and Strickland . After sifting through the blogs , he confronts Donna for her behavior at Goobersmooches and eventually makes amends with her . After being rehired as an accountant , Donna takes down the blogs and rearranges it to a down to business approach like Hank wanted . Roger `` Buddha '' Sack ( voiced by Chris Rock in the first appearance , Phil LaMarr in later appearances ) -- He first appeared in `` Traffic Jam '' as a comedian and traffic school instructor . His abrasive and insulting style of humor infuriates Hank , as well as the dean of the traffic school , who terminates his employment at the traffic school for not teaching traffic safety as he was hired to do . Hank later gets Roger a job at Strickland Propane . Grateful to Hank for saving him from unemployment , Roger 's attitude mellows afterward . Elizabeth `` Miz Liz '' Strickland ( voiced by Kathleen Turner ) -- Elizabeth is the deep - voiced , long suffering wife of Buck Strickland , first seen in `` Hanky Panky '' . In `` Hanky Panky '' , the first half of a two - part episode , Miz Liz confronts Buck at an awards dinner while he is there with his mistress . She files for divorce from Buck and subsequently takes control of Strickland Propane . This forces Buck to move in with Debbie . She promotes Hank to manager and attempts to seduce Hank in a propane - powered hot tub . However , the interest was not reciprocated . She brags to Buck about this , Buck , in turn , surprises Hank with a loaded shotgun expressing his jealousy . She and Buck reconcile in the second half `` High Anxiety '' , but later on , in `` The Good Buck '' , Buck claims that Miz Liz has left for good , stating that `` she could handle my drinkin ' binges , and my gamblin ' , and even turn a blind eye to my extramarital escapades , but not when they happen all once ! ... and on her birthday ! '' Debbie Grund ( voiced by Reese Witherspoon ) -- Debbie was an employee of Strickland Propane and was Buck Strickland 's mistress and the main antagonist in the episode `` Hanky Panky '' . As revenge for Buck ending their relationship , she plotted to murder him but accidentally killed herself with Buck 's shotgun while attempting to climb into the dumpster she was using as a hiding place . Tom Landry middle school ( edit ) Carl Moss ( voiced by Dennis Burkley ) -- Carl is the principal of Tom Landry Middle School , one of Hank 's high school classmates , and played Center for their football team . His primary concerns are tight budgets , maintaining discipline and the schools zero tolerance policy for `` everything '' . He tends to follow procedure to avoid trouble , even when it conflicts with his friendship with Hank . A highly changed person , Hank will often remind Carl of how he used to be and insinuate that Carl sold out for a position of power . He frequently rejects staff demands for better teaching aids , citing budget cuts ; he once referred to wood being used in shop class as a `` fancy teaching aid '' . Often the center of various scandals at the school , he permitted installation of soda dispensing vending machines solely for raising funds for staff vacations and purposely placed lazy students into special education classes to avoid state mandated exams ( whose grades would heavily affect school funding ) . Once when one of Dale 's plots to get rid of Moss came to nothing before they got started , Bill mentioned that Moss could n't hide behind inflated test scores forever . Coach Kleehammer ( voiced by Toby Huss ) -- Coach Kleehammer is the football coach at Tom Landry Middle School . He has a difficult time relating to things outside of football and often uses football - related expressions in everyday speech . Kleehammer is portrayed as something of a sexist , having displayed a very negative attitude towards women 's sports . Stuart Dooley ( voiced by Mike Judge ) -- Stuart ( often referred to simply as Dooley ) is Bobby 's deep - voiced , laconic classmate . He always sardonically intones something obvious after witnessing an event ( for example , to Bobby after witnessing Mega Lo Mart exploding , `` Your Dad got blown up . '' ) He also is somewhat of a rebel , and was seen pulling Peggy 's pants down , and smoking at one point . His style of speech is similar to Butt - Head from Mike Judge 's previous show , Beavis and Butt - Head , albeit without Butt - Head 's trademark giggling . Clark Peters ( voiced by Pamela Adlon ) -- Bobby 's overweight bully at Tom Landry Middle School . He has a blond ponytail and speaks as though he has a perpetual head cold ( Minh once referred to him as `` that creepy booger - nosed kid '' ) . He sometimes forces Bobby to do homework for him . Randy Miller ( voiced by Cheryl Holliday in 1997 -- 1999 , David Herman in 2000 -- 2009 ) -- Randy is the quintessential `` nerd '' who loves to tattle on people and then see them being punished . Bobby , Connie , and Joseph do n't like him very much , though Bobby once stopped Dooley from beating him up . He is very proud of his father being a successful patent lawyer . Although once a rather prominent character , he largely vanished after the fifth season . Chane Wassonasong ( voiced by Pamela Adlon ) -- Chane is a smart but obnoxious and rude classmate of Bobby and Connie . Connie 's parents are constantly trying to fix her up with Chane , also Laotian - American , as they see him as a very preferable alternative to Bobby ( and because Chane is the son of prominent Laotian - American Ted Wassonasong , with whom they are constantly trying to curry favor ) Emily ( voiced by Ashley Johnson ) -- She is a sixth grade blonde pony - tailed hall monitor who takes her position quite seriously . She often serves as the gatekeeper of Principal Moss ' office .

Lori ( voiced by Jillian Bowen ) - A classmate of Bobby and Joseph . Joseph once dated her , having made out in closets throughout the school on several occasions . Very late into the series , Lori insisted that she and Joseph go `` all the way '' in their relationship , but Joseph broke up with her before it could happen . Arlen vfw ( edit ) Sgt . `` Topsy '' Toppington ( voiced by Stephen Root ) -- Toppington ( nearly always referred to as `` Topsy '' ) is an old wartime buddy of Cotton Hill . He often acts as an accomplice to Cotton 's schemes . He could inflate his cheeks in a manner similar to Dizzy Gillespie , and according to Cotton , he was legally blind and had to have all his teeth pulled out because they were badly decayed . In `` Death Buys a Timeshare , '' his death is confirmed as Cotton is left his estate . Topsy was apparently cremated and his remains flushed down a toilet once used by General George S. Patton , as his name can be seen along with all of Cotton 's war buddies above the toilet . Stinkey ( voiced by Edward Asner ) -- Stinkey is one of Cotton Hill 's wartime friends who was overweight and had suffered from diabetes , he died at some point later in the series as it is mentioned by Cotton and his name is among the veterans ' ashes flushed down the toilet that General Patton used .

Other recurring characters ( edit ) John Redcorn ( voiced by Victor Aaron in 1997 , Jonathan Joss in 1998 -- 2009 ) -- John is Nancy 's American Indian former `` healer '' and adulterous lover , and the biological father of Joseph . He is a former roadie for Winger and lead singer of Big Mountain Fudgecake . In Season 9 , he began writing and performing his own children 's music . He works out of his trailer as a masseur , though his clients are generally only women . It is implied that he has a history of having sex with them , as Hank is horrified when Peggy goes to see him , and John Redcorn even states to him , `` Hank , I consider you a friend . I would never heal your wife the way I heal the wives of others . '' He is also active in American Indian rights campaigns , and Dale once helped him with a lawsuit that netted him twelve acres of land from the Federal government . However he was manipulated into building a casino on the property which was later found to be prohibited in Texas whose tribes forfeit gaming rights for federal recognition and his property was permitted for hazardous dumping to pay the debt . Because Dale had been so helpful , Redcorn felt extremely guilty over what he did with Nancy , and ended his affair by encouraging Nancy and Dale to strengthen their marriage . He eventually got back together with an ex-lover and became a dedicated husband and father to the children he had with her . Ted Wassonasong and Cindy Wassonasong ( voiced by Mike Judge and Lauren Tom respectively ) -- Ted and Cindy are affluent Laotian - American acquaintances of the Souphanousinphones . Kahn and Minh envy and resent them , but go to great lengths to gain their favor , such as inviting them over for dinner . They live in the upscale , gated community of Arlen Heights , and are prominent members of Nine Rivers Country Club . Ted and Cindy tolerate the Souphanousinphones but , in reality , look down upon them . They joined the Episcopal Church despite being Buddhist because it was `` good for business . '' Ted is also blatantly hypocritical . He referred to Kahn as a `` Banana '' ( an ethnic slur to identify an Asian American apparently lost in touch with their ethnic identity ; more comfortable with Western society ) even though Ted possesses far greater degree of luxury commodities , and lost most of his accent . He also helped pass a city ordinance banning the use of trans fats in only to be immediately found consuming the very foods he helped prohibit . Octavio ( voiced by Mike Judge ) -- Octavio is a Hispanic quasi-mercenary who does various bizarre favors for Dale when paid enough money , such as breaking into the Hill 's home in the middle of the night to look for Dale 's kidney ( earlier in the episode , Hank , who was legally Dale for three days while Dale was in hospital to give his kidney to NHRA drag racer John Force , was forced to help Octavio bash his own car with re-bar to try and claim motor accident insurance , a scheme he had cook up with Dale ) . On his chest is a large Rob Zombie tattoo which he once tried to pass off as a tattoo of Jesus in order to join Luanne 's Bible study group because she was conducting lessons in her pool while wearing a two piece bikini . His appearance was modelled after actor Danny Trejo ( who actually voices Enrique on the show ) . His last appearance was a non-speaking cameo in Just Another Manic - Kahn Day . M.F. ( Milton Friedman ) Thatherton ( voiced by Burt Reynolds in the first appearance , Toby Huss in later appearances ) -- M.F. is a former employee of Strickland Propane and another antagonist who strikes out on his own and opens up the crooked Thatherton Fuels company across the street from Strickland . He dresses like an old school rich cowboy with a ten - gallon hat and cowboy boots . An untrustworthy type , Thatherton is a sometime foil to Hank Hill and / or Buck . His sins are similar to Buck Strickland 's ( womanizing , gambling , using people ) , but more pronounced . Thatherton openly considers customers as little more than moneymakers and hires centerfold models or Hooters girls to bait potential propane customers . Hank , who also despises him , was forced to work for Thatherton for a week due to Buck losing at a game of cards . Reverend Thomason ( voiced by Maurice LaMarche ) -- A reverend at Arlen First Methodist Church . He was replaced by Reverend Karen Stroup upon retiring to start an online ministry .

She did n't take it well but there has been no talk about their relationship since that episode . Jimmy Whichard ( voiced by David Herman ) -- Jimmy is the town imbecile , and the main antagonist in `` Life in the Fast Lane - Bobby 's Saga '' . He has had several jobs , including concession manager at the racetrack and outsider artist . Dale notes that he may have given himself brain damage from staring into the sun for too long , although `` he ca n't have been too bright to do it in the first place . '' When Peggy was scammed by an internet test that `` proved '' she was a genius , she only believed it to be a scam upon learning that Jimmy was also proclaimed a genius . Chuck Mangione ( voiced by Himself ) -- Chuck is a famous jazz trumpeter and flugelhorn player , and his hit song `` Feels So Good '' is played frequently on the show . He shamelessly promotes Mega-Lo Mart until he grows tired of going to every new store opening ( he told Dale that he did n't read the contract properly , stating that Mega-Lo Mart opened 400 new stores per year and it left him no time to tour , record or be with his family ) . This forced him to disappear where Dale discovers he has become a hermit , living within the Arlen Mega-Lo Mart in a `` Toilet Paper Castle '' and stealing stocked items at night when the store is closed . When he tells Dale that he disappeared to `` stick it to the man '' , Dale decides to keep his secret and Mangione goes on living in the store undetected . Monsignor Martinez ( voiced by Mike Judge ) -- The Monsignor is the gun - toting priest hero of the fictional TV series Los Dias y Las Noches de Monsignor Martinez , a favorite of many of the principal characters . Clips of his program are often inserted into episodes as part of a running gag . In one of the episodes , Hank mentions that Martinez is an undercover cop . The clips of his episodes which appear on the series usually feature him just about to kill one of his nemeses while solemnly uttering his catchphrase , `` Vaya con Dios '' ; often preceding a melodramatic explosion . In the 8th season episode `` Flirting with the Master , '' the actor who plays Martinez invites Peggy to Mexico City to tutor his children , and she mistakes his interest for romantic passion . A live - action pilot was filmed featuring the character , but never aired because FOX did n't think it would have been a good idea to have a show about a Catholic priest shooting people . Lane Pratley ( voiced by Dwight Yoakam in the first appearance , Dave Thomas in later appearances ) -- Lane is a sleazy car dealer who owns `` Pratley Ford '' and `` Pratley Hyundai , '' and as he says , `` I got my eye on Pratley Cadillac -- my daddy ai n't doing so good . '' Lane once owned a women 's roller derby team that Peggy and Luanne skated for , before Peggy organized the skaters into a buyout and quit . Mark Buckley ( voiced by David Herman ) -- Buckley was the slacker boyfriend of Luanne . He was killed in a propane explosion by his own negligence while working at Mega-Lo Mart in the second season finale , having dragged a propane tank by the valve instead of its handles resulting in leak . The character did return once ( as an angel ) on the episode `` Wings of the Dope , '' where Kahn buys Buckley 's trampoline for his backyard and Luanne ( who has been stressed over beauty school finals ) begins seeing Buckley 's angel . Officer Brown ( voiced by Fred Willard ) -- Officer Brown is a local police officer in Arlen who is not averse to tampering with evidence and taking bribes from illegal food operations , as explained in episodes 20 and 11 ( respectively ) of season 12 . In the episode `` Cops and Roberts , '' Principal Moss states that `` Officer Brown may be a disgraced cop who tampered with evidence ... but this here used to be a man '' . His appearance is modeled after his voice actor . Brown ( as well as other Arlen police officers ) were seen to be ' starstruck ' by fictional ex-Dallas Cowboy player Willie Lane ( and his 1978 Super Bowl ring ) and refused to arrest him for felonies against Hank and Kahn after finding out who he was in the episode `` New Cowboy on the Block '' . Jack ( voiced by Brian Doyle - Murray ) -- Jack is Hank 's mentally unstable barber . Eventually , his distress affects his ability to style hair , causing Hank great embarrassment .

'' In `` Bystand Me '' ( his debut episode ) , he tells Peggy that whenever he gets writer 's block , he hires a prostitute . Miss Kremzer ( voiced by Jennifer Coolidge ) -- The teacher at the beauty school Luanne went to . She is very condescending towards Luanne in her first appearance . After Hank 's speech that gets Kremzer to change her grade for Luanne , she acts sympathetic along with the other students , but is right back to her previously - displayed bad attitude in subsequent episodes . Sharona Johnson ( voiced by Dawnn Lewis ) -- A girl that goes to the same beauty school that Luanne went to , Sharona is hardworking and intelligent but is also very arrogant and puts down Luanne constantly .

David `` The Flyin ' Hawaiian '' Kalaiki - Ali'i ( voiced by Brendan Fraser ) -- David is the star football player for Arlen High School in the episode `` Peggy Makes The Big Leagues .

Due to the No Pass No Play policy , David is prevented from playing football until he raises his grades , earning Peggy the ire of the local booster club . The club and school employees fabricate evidence that David was Learning disabled which he admitted was untrue although his grammar , handwriting and mathematical reasoning are poor . Realizing his chances for playing in professional sports are statistically low , he agrees to be tutored by Peggy to have something to fall back on . Mrs. Kalaiki - Ali'i ( voiced by Amy Hill ) -- A Hawaiian insurance agent Hank visits when Kahn backs into Hank 's truck with his van .

He also seems to be a lazy cook , noting , `` Did you know you have to heat up Italian food ? '' . After the apparent failure of the Showbiz Deli , we encounter Carl again in Bad Girls , Bad Girls , Whatcha Gonna Do ? , again having switched his menu , this time to sushi , another food that can be served raw . In this later episode , it appears that Carl 's business is dong much better , as the scenes of the sushi restaurant show many customers inside .

Tammi Duvall ( voiced by Renée Zellweger ) -- Tammi is a prostitute who was from Oklahoma City , Oklahoma ( referred to as The `` OKC '' ) in the episode `` Ho Yeah ! '' . She was hired at Strickland Propane and went to lunch with Peggy . The pair become fast friends , and Tammi has expressed her desire to get her GED . Peggy decided to tutor Tammi , and because Tammi does not have a place to live , she is welcomed to stay in the den , much to Hank 's objections .

When Tammi requests that Hank stops the car so she can exit and return with Alabaster to Oklahoma City , Hank slams on the brakes . He steps out of the car and tells Alabaster to do likewise . Hank then hands Alabaster all of the cash Tammi gave him and states that Tammi is now his `` ho '' , making Alabaster nervous as Hank is bigger than Alabaster . Alabaster takes the money and tries to get Peggy , but Hank refused , telling Alabaster that Peggy is his wife , and Alabaster drives off . Cane Skretteburg ( voiced by Tré Cool ) -- Cane Skretteburg is the lead singer of a punk rock garage band and one of the main antagonists in the episode `` The Man Who Shot Kane Skretteburg '' .

( September 2013 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) King of the Hill is an American animated sitcom created by Mike Judge and Greg Daniels . The main characters are Hank Hill , Peggy Hill , Bobby Hill , Luanne Platter , Dale Gribble , Bill Dauterive , Jeff Boomhauer , Kahn Souphanousinphone , and Elroy `` Lucky '' Kleinschmidt . Contents ( hide ) 1 Main characters 2 Other Hill , Platter , and Kleinschmidt relatives 3 Other Gribbles 4 Other Dauterives 5 Other Boomhauers 6 Souphanousinphones 7 Strickland Propane 8 Tom Landry Middle School 9 Arlen VFW 10 Other recurring characters 11 Other characters 12 References 13 External links Main characters ( edit ) Henry `` Hank '' Rutherford Hill ( voiced by Mike Judge ) -- Hank is the main protagonist who proudly sells `` propane and propane accessories '' as the assistant manager at Strickland Propane , and throughout the entire series always makes a big deal about the job when everybody around Hank finds his occupation boring . As told in the episode `` Movin ' On Up '' and `` Chasing Bobby '' , Hank uses his lawn and his truck as escapism , Putting countless hours and days into tasks for the purpose of enjoyment or escaping from his troubled home life when times are tough . He resembles -- in both voice and appearance -- the Tom Anderson character from Beavis and Butthead , a character also voiced by Judge . Hank is generally a well - meaning father , but is often confused and anxious towards modern trends and the antics of his friends and family members . He suffers from a narrow urethra , which made Bobby 's conception difficult . Hank is uncomfortable with public displays of intimacy with his wife and son . He has a very difficult time saying `` I love you '' to any member of his family , as he thinks it is unmanly . Hank 's trademark exclamation when surprised or angered or in times of discomfort ( sounding like `` Bwaaa ! '' ) and his phrase `` I tell you what '' ( `` what '' in his dialect being pronounced ( ʍʌt ) ) are running gags on the series . Hank is a byproduct of a bygone era , nevertheless the qualities are principled ; ever faithful , friendly , firm , reasonable , well - read and hard working . Much of the series revolves around Hank 's desire to do the right thing compared to much of the rest of the people around him who would rather cheat , lie or exploit . Hank is a proud Texan , having grown up there . He was , however , born in a ladies room at Yankee Stadium , and spent the first three days of his life in New York City . Margaret J. `` Peggy '' Platter Hill ( voiced by Kathy Najimy ) -- Hank 's wife , Peggy ( née Platter ) , was born in Montana and raised on her family 's cattle ranch . Her strained relationship with her mother is a source of drama for her . Peggy is a substitute teacher in Arlen , Texas , specializing in teaching Spanish despite having a terrible grasp of the language . Peggy is also a freelance newspaper columnist , notary public , an exemplary softball pitcher and a Boggle champion and has started a career in real estate . She has a habit of adding or changing ingredients to ordinary dishes then naming them after herself . `` Spa - Peggy & Meatballs '' and `` Apple Brown Peggy '' are examples . Peggy is very self - conscious about her larger - than - normal feet ( size 16 1⁄2 on the left , 16 on the right ) . Despite boasting of her intelligence , she has been the victim of manipulation , such as being conned out of $2,500 for a phony degree , indoctrinated into a homogenous cult , and tricked into a pyramid scheme selling Herbalife inspired products . She has brown hair and typically wears glasses , an aquamarine sleeveless shirt , and denim culottes , but often wears different outfits . Robert Jeffrey `` Bobby '' Hill ( voiced by Pamela Adlon ) -- Hank and Peggy 's husky 13 - year - old son and best friend to Joseph and Connie . Although friendly , gentle , lovable , and generally well - liked , he is not very bright and often prone to making bad decisions . He wants to be a famous prop comic and move to New York when he is older . Bobby displays little interest in gender roles and , although superb at golf and target shooting , dislikes team sports , often taking such classes as Home Economics and Peer Counseling , instead of more traditionally `` masculine classes '' . Although many ( including Hank ) tend to typify him as `` not right '' , he is romantically successful , dating Connie and other girls throughout the series . And as Hank puts it when referring to Bobby in the episode `` An Officer and a Gentle Boy '' `` born a pile of mush , mush is n't all bad . You can keep stomping on it but it 's all give ; it just stays mush . You ca n't build it up but you ca n't break it down , either . In a funny way , mush kind of has the edge '' Dale Alvin Gribble A.K.A. `` Rusty Shackleford '' ( voiced by Johnny Hardwick ) -- Dale is the Hills ' chain - smoking neighbor who is also an insect exterminator among various self - appointed occupations . His physical appearance was modeled after Hunter S. Thompson . His greatest expertise lies in his knowledge of conspiracy theories and loopholes . Dale is paranoid about any government activity and frequently uses the alias of Rusty Shackleford to operate anonymously including having received unemployment payments from said alias . Dale is the president of the Arlen gun club and a licensed bounty hunter . He possesses a vast collection of guns from pistols to automatic weapons and is an ardent defender of Second Amendment rights . Despite being a firearms aficionado , his aim is relatively poor and despite being knowledgeable in military matters , he is physically the weakest of the main cast and is an abject physical coward . He is an avid UFOlogist . Dale remains oblivious to the fact that his wife , Nancy , has cheated on him with John Redcorn for fourteen years and his son Joseph is not actually his biological son . Everyone else knows but chooses not to tell him because of his total obliviousness , the loving , trusting relationship he has with Joseph and Nancy , and the fact that Dale is more of a father to Joseph than John Redcorn is , although it is implied in one of the last scenes of the final episode that Dale found out somehow and is rather unconcerned , leading to the possibility he either knew all along , Nancy told him , or he found out through other means . Hank considers Dale a close friend , but he often gets annoyed with his schemes and conspiracies . Sgt . William `` Bill '' Fontaine de La Tour Dauterive ( voiced by Stephen Root ) -- Bill is the Hills ' overweight , divorced , clinically depressed neighbor . He grew up in Louisiana with his cousin Gilbert and speaks French and English . He was formerly a rugged and attractive star lineman on Arlen High 's football team , nicknamed the `` Billdozer '' , and is now a sergeant barber in the United States Army . While his job mostly consists of shaving recruits , he is in fact an extremely talented barber able to replicate Hank 's signature flattop when his barber he had known for 20 years was becoming senile . Bill once had a bright future in the Army wanting to be a tanker , but ended up ruining his life after marrying the promiscuous Lenore . Bill is something of a masochist and is often attracted to people who abuse him ; after suffering under his father and Lenore , Bill has an almost complete lack of self - worth . He obsesses about his ex-wife , and his loneliness is a running gag on the series . He frequently tries to flirt with and win over Peggy . Despite coming across as a loser , however , Bill has enjoyed several romantic successes ( or near - successes ) , including Kahn 's and Luanne 's mothers , former Texas governor Ann Richards , and the young widows of two of his dead cousins . He is named after executive producer and writer Jim Dauterive . Jeffrey Dexter `` Jeff '' Boomhauer III ( voiced by Mike Judge ) -- Often referred to as his surname , Boomhauer is a slim womanizer whose mutterings are hard to understand to the audience but easily understood by his friends . A running joke is when his friends fail to understand him for some reason other than his incoherence . His speech is usually heavily littered with the phrases , `` dang '' and `` dang ol ' '' . Boomhauer can mumble his words , but he sings clearly and speaks other languages clearly ( mainly French and Spanish ) . Boomhauer is a classic - car aficionado and owns a 1969 Dodge Coronet Super Bee ( in high school he owned a late 1960s Ford Mustang nicknamed `` Ms. Sally '' ) , and , despite his incoherent ramblings and womanizing , often displays himself to be more intelligent and philosophical than his three friends . Although hinted at previously , in episode 18 of season 13 , his first name is finally revealed when a Canadian woman who lives next door to the family who trades houses with him for the summer calls him `` Jeff '' , and the driver 's license shown in the series finale reads `` Boomhauer , Jeff '' . Throughout the series it is never known what he does for a living , although it was revealed in an early episode that he was an electrical engineer but was on workers compensation . At the end of the series finale , a badge seen in his open wallet reveals that he is a Texas Ranger . Luanne Leanne Platter Kleinschmidt ( voiced by Brittany Murphy ) -- Luanne ( née Platter ) is the Hills ' college - age niece , daughter of Peggy 's scheming paternal twin brother Hoyt and his alcoholic ex-wife Leanne . Luanne moves in with the Hills after her mother Leanne stabs Hoyt with a fork during a drunken fight which tips over their trailer . Hank initially makes frequent attempts to encourage Luanne to move out on her own , but later more - or-less accepts her as a member of the family . She was a student at the beauty academy and later at Arlen Community College . She was often portrayed as an airhead , but was shown to be an expert mechanic in the first two seasons and is good at logic puzzles . Luanne was promiscuous , but she settles down after being visited by the spirit of her first boyfriend , the slacker Buckley , whom she calls `` Buckley 's angel '' ; and then attending a church - sponsored `` born - again virgin '' program and starts a Bible study class . Luanne created a puppet show entitled `` The Manger Babies '' for a Public - access television cable TV station , featuring the barnyard animals who witnessed Christ 's birth ( though they included a penguin and an octopus ) . In the 10th - season finale , Luanne revealed that she was pregnant with the child of Lucky , whom she married in the 11th - season finale . In the 13th and final season , she has a baby girl named Gracie Margaret Kleinschmidt . She wears a green sleeveless shirt and red capris , and appears to be about 5 ft 6 in ( 1.68 m ) . Other Hill , Platter , and Kleinschmidt relatives ( edit ) Ladybird Hill -- The Hills ' thirteen - year - old purebred Georgia Bloodhound named after the First Lady of the United States Lady Bird Johnson . It 's said that her mother helped track down James Earl Ray , as revealed by Hank in episode 7 of season 1 titled `` Westie Side Story '' . Her companionship temporarily relieved Hank 's stress ( and narrow urethra ) , allowing him to impregnate Peggy . Later on in the series Ladybird would become deaf and despite much effort on Hank 's part , would never bear puppies because of her narrow uterus . Col. Cotton Lyndal Hill ( voiced by Toby Huss ) -- Hank 's cantankerous father , Peggy 's father - in - law and Bobby 's grandfather he has a hair - trigger temper . Despite his many shortcomings , he occasionally showed a softer side , for example in the episode `` Cotton 's Plot '' where he helped Peggy learn to walk again after her parachuting accident . His shins were blown off in World War II by a `` Japan man 's machine gun '' and his feet were reattached to his knees , resulting in a short height and stilted gait . Despite his disability , he eventually reached the rank of colonel in the state militia . After Cotton and his first wife Tillie , Hank 's mother , divorced , he married a much younger , soft - spoken , busty blonde candy striper named Didi who gave birth to his youngest son `` G.H. '' ( `` Good Hank '' ) . He was immensely proud of his military service . Though his claim of fighting `` nazzies '' ( Nazis ) was proven false and his claim of killing `` fitty ( fifty ) men '' was dubious , his participation in several of the bloodiest battles in the Pacific Theater was confirmed and his uniform was shown to be decorated with the Medal of Honor and the Purple Heart . Cotton himself died in episode # 1218 , `` Death Picks Cotton '' , after suffering severe burns and an allergic reaction to shrimp during a flashback at a Japanese restaurant . Instead of addressing Peggy by her name he calls her `` Hank 's wife '' . Didi Hill ( voiced by Ashley Gardner ) -- Didi is Cotton 's second wife , Hank 's stepmother , Peggy 's stepmother - in - law and Bobby 's stepgrandmother she 's a candy striper after she retired from being an exotic dancer . She has breast implants and suffers from postpartum depression following the birth of Cotton 's third son `` G.H. '' She is generally depicted as docile and unintelligent , although she is a certified optometry assistant . She was absent at the time of Cotton 's death and was only seen once more , where she says she is engaged and will remarry . Didi was a classmate of Hank 's in Kindergarten ( indicating they are the same age ) . Good Hank Jeffrey `` G.H. '' Hill -- G.H. is Cotton 's and Didi 's infant son , and the younger of Hank 's two half - brothers . G.H. is an abbreviation for `` Good Hank , '' implying that the original Hank was unsatisfactory to his father . Cotton treats G.H. much better than Hank presumably because Cotton sees him as being his second chance of being a better father than he was for Hank . G.H. was key at a time when Hank had to convince Cotton not to end his life as well as to permit Hank to give his father money for the baby 's sake ( and as payback for the years Cotton raised him ) . G.H. was absent at the time of his father 's death , and is not seen throughout the rest of the series , although it is presumed he is living with his mother and stepfather . Matilda `` Tillie '' Mae Hill Garrison ( voiced by Tammy Wynette in 1997 -- 1998 , Beth Grant in 1999 , and K Callan in 2000 -- 2009 ) -- Tillie is Cotton 's first wife , Hank 's mother , Peggy 's mother - in - law and Bobby 's grandmother . She divorced Cotton after suffering years of verbal abuse . Tillie is a kind woman who collects miniatures because they made her happy during Cotton 's abuse . Hank is often over-protective of her , fearing she is too old and fragile to go out and do things on her own . Tillie lives in Arizona with her husband Chuck , having formerly lived with her Jewish boyfriend Gary ( voiced by Carl Reiner ) . Tillie 's legal name varies during the series . She is listed as `` Tillie '' on Hank 's birth certificate , but is addressed as Matilda by the clergyman during her wedding to Chuck . Elroy `` Lucky '' Kleinschmidt ( voiced by Tom Petty ) -- Lucky is Luanne 's itinerant , but generally benign redneck husband , and is the father of Luanne 's child . It 's often hard for Lucky to hold down a job ( he has no credit or Social Security number ) . He lives on the remainder of the $53,000 `` settlement monies '' he received after `` slipping on pee - pee at the Costco '' having had a portion of his spine fused . He was nicknamed `` Lucky '' after the settlement windfall . After he spent a majority of his money customizing his truck , his finances dwindled down to nine thousand dollars but regained another $53,000 when an ambulance chasing lawyer paid off Lucky to avoid a lawsuit . Peggy tried very hard to break him and Luanne apart , but after Luanne 's pregnancy was revealed , she and Hank reconciled the two , giving them a shotgun wedding at Lucky 's request . He is also one of the guitarists for John Redcorn 's band `` Big Mountain Fudgecake '' . Although dimwitted in some aspects , Lucky has learned some facets such as basic math through life experience as opposed to formal education , and was astute enough to deduce that his father - in - law spent time in jail whereas Luanne believed the story that he works on an oil rig . He yearned to receive his GED but only to prove he was good enough to marry Luanne . Gracie Margaret Kleinschmidt -- Daughter of Lucky and Luanne . She was born in the season 13 episode `` Lucky See , Monkey Do '' . Luanne originally wanted to name her Lasagna ( stating that lasagna was their favorite food ) while under the influence of hospital analgesics , but choosing a more conventional name after she had recovered . Myrna Kleinschmidt ( voiced by Paget Brewster ) -- Myrna is Lucky 's sister , Luanne 's sister - in - law , Gracie 's aunt and the main antagonist in `` Lucky See , Monkey Do '' . She is an intelligent , modern mother who only appears in the episode `` Lucky See , Monkey Do '' . She has two children , one son and one daughter ( Gracie 's paternal first cousins ) and raises them in strict accordance with contemporary parenting practices , something which leads her into a rivalry with Peggy , whose parenting skills are from older schools of thought , over how to assist Luanne as her pregnancy due date approaches . When Luanne goes into labor , Myrna commandeers the situation and insists that Luanne have a natural , drug - free water birth , but under Hank 's encouragement to think for themselves about how to raise their child , Luanne and Lucky opt for a hospital birth instead . Leanne Platter ( voiced by Pamela Adlon ) -- Leanne , Luanne 's violent alcoholic mother , Gracie 's grandmother , Bobby 's aunt and Lucky 's mother - in - law she was imprisoned for `` second - degree assaulting '' her husband in the back with a fork . Though she is often mentioned during the course of the series , she appears only in the episode `` Leanne 's Saga , '' visiting Luanne in Arlen after her release from prison and briefly being courted by Bill Dauterive . Hoyt Platter ( voiced by Johnny Knoxville ) -- Hoyt is Luanne 's father , Peggy 's twin brother , Hank 's brother - in - law , Bobby 's uncle , Lucky 's father - in - law , Gracie 's grandfather and Leanne 's ex-husband . Despite Luanne 's beliefs , he never worked on an oil rig , but was in jail for most of Luanne 's life , with the oil rig story acting as a cover so Luanne would n't know her father was a convict . He appears in only one episode : `` Life : A Loser 's Manual '' . After being released from jail , Hoyt commits a robbery and tricks Lucky into taking the blame , but he eventually confesses and is sentenced to life in prison under a three - strikes law . The episode `` Leanne 's Saga '' reveals that Hoyt was planning on marrying a pharmacist girl before Leanne , then working as a stripper , entertained at his bachelor party . Maddy Platter ( voiced by Joanna Gleason ) -- Maddy Platter is Peggy 's and Hoyt 's mother , Hank 's mother - in - law and Bobby 's and Luanne 's grandmother . Mother Platter lives in Montana with her son Hoyt . She 's an old - fashioned , tough - as - nails rancher type and loathes Peggy for deserting the family ranch and not marrying a local neighbor boy . Strangely , earlier episode flashbacks feature a totally different `` Peggy 's mother '' character , who is essentially an older version of Peggy -- it 's not made clear if one is her real mother and one is her stepmother , or if the `` Maddy '' mother character retconned the older version completely . Doc Platter -- Doc is Peggy 's and Hoyt 's father , Hank 's father - in - law and Bobby 's and Luanne 's grandfather . He makes only a single major appearance when Peggy , Bobby and Hank visit the family ranch . He seems to be going somewhat senile and preachy , which Hank misinterprets as old - fashion Western - style wisdom . Junichiro ( voiced by David Carradine ) -- Junichiro is Hank 's elder half - Japanese half - brother , Peggy 's half - brother - in - law and Bobby 's half - uncle who has lived in Japan all his life . Hank and Junichiro have the same father , due to Cotton 's affair with a Japanese nurse during his war days , and share many similarities in appearance and mannerisms ( this in spite of the fact that Hank actually shares more of his mother 's features ) ; one of these is that when he is shocked , like Hank , he yells `` BWAH ! '' Like Hank , Junichiro also has a narrow urethra and is an assistant manager at the company for which he works , making robots and robot accessories . Dusty Hill ( Himself ) -- The bassist / vocalist for the band ZZ Top and Hank 's cousin . In the episode `` Hank Gets Dusted , '' Cotton gives his prized Cadillac to Dusty without allowing Hank a chance to buy it . Dusty enters the car in a demolition derby in which it is badly damaged . Hank and Dusty make their peace after Dusty has the car repaired and installed at the Cadillac Ranch . Other gribbles ( edit ) Nancy Hicks - Gribble ( voiced by Ashley Gardner ) -- Nancy ( née Hicks ) is Dale 's wife , Joseph 's mother and weather - girl - turned - anchor for local news station Channel 84 . She had a fourteen - year affair with John Redcorn , which produced her son , Joseph , although she eventually broke off the affair and became a faithful wife to Dale . Redcorn refused to come back to her out of respect for Dale . Her mother Bunny was similarly unfaithful to Nancy 's father , but did not reveal her own long - term affair until Nancy began suffering from stress - induced hair loss over her unresolved feelings for John Redcorn . Nancy is a former beauty queen , a fact which helped her get her job as a news anchor . Joseph John Gribble ( voiced by Brittany Murphy in 1997 -- 2000 , Breckin Meyer in 2000 -- 2009 ) -- Dale and Nancy 's 13 - year - old son and one of Bobby 's best friends . Despite Joseph 's obvious Native American features , his similarity in appearance to John Redcorn , and the fact that his middle name is `` John , '' neither he nor Dale is aware that Redcorn is his biological father ( Nancy refers to Dale having a `` Jamaican grandmother '' to explain Joseph 's dark complexion ) . Redcorn 's occasional and awkward attempts to get closer to Joseph ( against Nancy 's wishes ) lead Joseph to regard him as strange and creepy . Joseph starts out as an ordinary teen , but eventually grows weird and creepy -- not to mention dim - witted . Joseph begins to take after Dale more than John , Nancy or even any of his friends . Joseph has a half - sister named Kate ( by John Redcorn having another affair ) , who is very similar to Joseph in personality and interests but likewise does not realize that Redcorn is their father . Joseph is the only character of the series shown to physically mature , having grown six inches in height over the course of a summer , a more built physique , athletic prowess and having a deeper voice and a wispy mustache upon his reappearance . Bug Gribble ( voiced by David Herman ) -- Bug is Dale 's father , Nancy 's father - in - law and Joseph 's grandfather , who had been estranged from Dale for many years for kissing Nancy at her and Dale 's wedding reception . Bug is actually gay and had been flirting with a Filipino caterer instead , and , upon sensing Dale 's imminent entry into the room , attempted to hide his orientation from his son by grabbing and kissing ' the nearest thing in a dress ' . This misunderstanding , and Bug 's inability to reveal his true sexuality to Dale , resulted in their estrangement . When Dale and Nancy renew their wedding vows 20 years afterward , Nancy arranges to invite Bug , and Dale initially suspects his odd behavior and his having a `` partner '' of meaning that Bug is an undercover government agent , but finally accepts the truth upon seeing Bug and his partner share a devoted kiss . Bug 's appearance in `` My Own Private Rodeo '' retcons his appearance in earlier episodes , where he bears a near - identicality to present - day Dale . Other Dauterives ( edit ) Gilbert Fontaine Dauterive ( voiced by David Herman ) -- Gilbert ( pronounced `` zhil - BEAR '' ) is Bill 's cousin . Though at one point shown to live on the family estate with his aunt and cousin in a Louisiana bayou in `` A Beer Can Named Desire '' , he and Bill eventually wind up as the last two living Dauterives . It is strongly implied that he is gay , and he even hits on Buck Strickland when Buck attempts to capitalize on the Dauterive family 's traditional barbecue sauce recipe in `` Blood and Sauce '' . Esmé Dauterive ( voiced by Meryl Streep ) -- Esmé was Bill and Gilbert 's aunt , and matriarch of the Dauterive clan . She expressed deep concern over the family 's ever - shrinking headcount , lamenting that `` the Dauterive blood is down to a trickle '' . She happily received Bill upon his return for a visit and was not displeased to see him and his cousins ' widows taking mutual interest .

Other Boomhauers ( edit ) Patch Boomhauer ( voiced by Brad Pitt ) -- Patch is Boomhauer 's sleazy , womanizing younger brother . He appears in `` Patch Boomhauer '' , apparently engaged to marry Boomhauer 's old flame , Katherine -- much to Boomhauer 's mounting displeasure , as he himself has unresolved feelings for Katherine , and Patch 's continued philandering angers him for her sake . The wedding is later called off after Patch hires strippers for his bachelor party and frames Boomhauer for trying to break up the engagement .

Souphanousinphones ( edit ) Kohng Koy `` Kahn '' Souphanousinphone ( voiced by Toby Huss ) -- Kahn is Hank 's materialistic , Laotian next - door neighbor , Minh 's husband , Connie 's father and main antagonist . He believes he 's better than his neighbors , often referring to them as `` hillbillies '' or `` rednecks '' . He frequently boasts of his superiority to the others and dreams of being far more successful than Ted Wassanasong . Despite his arrogant attitude , Kahn seeks approval and friendship from his down - to - earth neighbors , who are accepting and tolerant of his ways . He previously worked for a defense contractor that manufactured composite ceramic armor , but was fired for spilling company secrets . After a string of job failures ( due to his attitude ) he found a new job forcing him to commute . Upon recollection of the story of how Minh and Kahn met , it is revealed that he was a former rebel and playboy whom Minh chose over the straight - laced intellectual her father set her up with . In one episode , Kahn shows that he is a trained martial artist while getting into a fight with a few rednecks . In the episode `` Just Another Manic Kahn - Day '' , it is revealed that Kahn has bipolar disorder ( which was also mentioned in the earlier episode `` Lost in Myspace '' ) .

She is a crack shot , with championship - level skills , and at one point joined Dale 's gun club , exerting a positive effect on its members . She is highly competitive , going so far as to cheat on The New York Times crossword puzzle . Like her husband , Minh grew up in Laos , where her father was a powerful general in the army who was not happy with her decision to marry Kahn . She once told Nancy Gribble that she did n't grow up oppressed , rather because of her father 's high ranking position in the army , she `` was peasants ' worse nightmare '' , pointing to being a bully in her youth . She once unsuccessfully tried to teach Bobby the Laotian language . Kahn `` Connie '' Souphanousinphone , Jr. ( voiced by Lauren Tom ) -- Connie is the American - born daughter of Kahn and Minh . She is one of Bobby 's best friends and for a time his girlfriend . She is a violin player , `` A '' student , and general overachiever pressured by her mother and father , who hold her to very high standards . Though it is implied that she works hard because of her overbearing parents , in reality , she does it for herself . Connie is named after her egomaniacal father because he wanted a son .

She attended Tom Landry Middle School in the meantime . She seduced Bobby and tricked him into creating a meth lab by pretending to help him with building a candy machine for his group science project , and persuaded him to steal propane tanks from Strickland Propane to complete it . Tid Pao was caught by Connie and she was sent away by Kahn to Wisconsin to work on her last uncle 's dairy farm at the end of the episode because of her criminally - inclined nature . There her uncle told her she was on her last chance as he was the last relative left in America . Any more trouble would see her shipped off to live with her grandmother in Laos . Laoma Souphanousinphone ( voiced by Amy Hill ) -- Laoma is Kahn 's mother , Minh 's mother - in - law and Connie 's grandmother she 's the only person on the show who addresses him by his full name . She 's kind and hardworking and enjoys housekeeping . She is disliked by Minh because of her criticism of Minh 's housework skills . The status - conscious Kahn is horrified when Laoma , bored and unwanted by her daughter - in - law , becomes the Hills ' housekeeper , and even more horrified when she begins a love affair with Bill Dauterive . Laoma has not been seen since her first episode , mainly because the creators nixed the original plan for her and Bill to become a regular couple , preferring for Bill to remain his usual single and miserable self . General Gum ( voiced by James Sie ) -- Usually referred to as `` The General , '' ( his full name is Gum Nga Hexumalayasabrath ) he appeared only in the episodes `` Pour Some Sugar on Kahn '' ( in which he visits the family ) and `` Father of the Bribe '' ( in which Minh recalls her courtship by Kahn ) .

Strickland Propane ( edit ) Buck Strickland ( voiced by Stephen Root ) -- Buck is the slightly overweight , balding , over-the - hill owner of Strickland Propane , and Hank 's boss . His physical appearance greatly resembles Lyndon Johnson , particularly his hairline , and he has a habit of hosting employee discussions in his bathroom -- a habit of Johnson . Originally hailing from Arkansas , Buck was historically known for his modest start in business and general business smarts . These attributes have since been worn away by life and been replaced with many habits which often come in the way of his business decisions . Buck is a compulsive gambler to the point where he will use company profits to continue gaming , even betting in underground events . Also like LBJ , Buck is a chauvinist , alcoholic , and adulterer . It is often implied that Hank reveres Buck and that , in Hank 's eyes , the two have a close relationship . Compared to Hank who is the ultimate model of a good employee , Buck 's vices require Hank to keep an extremely close eye . Buck refers to Hank as his `` Golden Goose '' implying Hank is the only reason his business remains afloat and thus he would never fire him . Hank has used the threat of quitting to capitulate Buck 's transition from things Hank found unsavory . His health is questionable as he has suffered numerous infarctions and has had several cardiovascular surgeries including valve replacements . Despite his less than desirable traits , he has an ethical side although he planted evidence on Hank for murder rather than let his wife be arrested . Joe Jack ( voiced by Toby Huss ) -- Joe Jack is a fuel - truck driver and co-worker with Hank at Strickland Propane . He has a drinking problem , as seen when he is a member of the Propaniacs . Joe Jack has a habit of calling people he speaks to `` honey '' , regardless of their gender or level of familiarity with him . Enrique ( voiced by Eloy Casados from 1997 -- 1998 , Danny Trejo from 2002 -- 2009 ) -- Enrique is a good - natured Mexican - American truck driver at Strickland Propane . Originally he spoke with a very weak accent . In the episode `` Enrique - cilable Differences , '' Enrique forcibly befriends Hank after a nasty fight with his wife . Enrique ends up moving in with the Hills for a short time eventually developing a pathological attachment to the Hill family , but quickly patches things up with his wife after a fed - up Hank kicks him out . Enrique nearly lost his house due to rent increases when property values in his neighborhood skyrocket when Peggy began selling working class housing to upper - middle class Millennials . To solve the problem , Peggy helped the neighborhood value decline when she fabricated the area as uncool by making it appear as if typical middle - class families were moving in prompting the millennials to leave . Afterwards he applied and became a homeowner . While a hard worker , he has poor fiscal habits , often spending money on lavish outdoor parties to celebrate any seemingly significant event such as his daughter 's Quinceañera or becoming a homeowner . Donna ( voiced by Pamela Adlon ) -- There are actually two separate Donnas who have both worked as Strickland accountants , and are often referred to as `` Donna from Accounting '' . The first Donna appears , albeit infrequently , as an overweight , dark - skinned woman , most notably in `` Meet the Propaniacs '' . In `` Are You There , God ? It 's Me , Margaret Hill '' , Buck mentions having discovered stolen office supplies in her bedroom ( presumably during an extramarital encounter ) , and orders Hank to `` find us a new Donna '' . The `` new Donna '' is a tall , curvy white woman who first appears in `` The Miseducation of Bobby Hill '' . In `` 24 Hour Propane People '' she mentions a husband ; in `` You Gotta Believe ( In Moderation ) '' , Dale notes her `` recent divorce '' . In `` Lost in MySpace '' , her most significant episode , she is briefly promoted to assistant manager alongside Hank , which did n't settle in well with him . She often uses MySpace during work hours and ignored Hank when he asked her for a down to business approach . In turn , Donna is briefly fired when some of her MySpace friends mistook Buck for Hank and brutally beat him up . She sought revenge against Hank by making rude comments about him and Strickland . After sifting through the blogs , he confronts Donna for her behavior at Goobersmooches and eventually makes amends with her . After being rehired as an accountant , Donna takes down the blogs and rearranges it to a down to business approach like Hank wanted . Roger `` Buddha '' Sack ( voiced by Chris Rock in the first appearance , Phil LaMarr in later appearances ) -- He first appeared in `` Traffic Jam '' as a comedian and traffic school instructor . His abrasive and insulting style of humor infuriates Hank , as well as the dean of the traffic school , who terminates his employment at the traffic school for not teaching traffic safety as he was hired to do . Hank later gets Roger a job at Strickland Propane . Grateful to Hank for saving him from unemployment , Roger 's attitude mellows afterward . Elizabeth `` Miz Liz '' Strickland ( voiced by Kathleen Turner ) -- Elizabeth is the deep - voiced , long suffering wife of Buck Strickland , first seen in `` Hanky Panky '' . In `` Hanky Panky '' , the first half of a two - part episode , Miz Liz confronts Buck at an awards dinner while he is there with his mistress . She files for divorce from Buck and subsequently takes control of Strickland Propane . This forces Buck to move in with Debbie . She promotes Hank to manager and attempts to seduce Hank in a propane - powered hot tub . However , the interest was not reciprocated . She brags to Buck about this , Buck , in turn , surprises Hank with a loaded shotgun expressing his jealousy . She and Buck reconcile in the second half `` High Anxiety '' , but later on , in `` The Good Buck '' , Buck claims that Miz Liz has left for good , stating that `` she could handle my drinkin ' binges , and my gamblin ' , and even turn a blind eye to my extramarital escapades , but not when they happen all once ! ... and on her birthday ! '' Debbie Grund ( voiced by Reese Witherspoon ) -- Debbie was an employee of Strickland Propane and was Buck Strickland 's mistress and the main antagonist in the episode `` Hanky Panky '' .

Tom Landry middle school ( edit ) Carl Moss ( voiced by Dennis Burkley ) -- Carl is the principal of Tom Landry Middle School . Moss is one of Hank 's high school classmates ; he played center for their football team . His primary concerns are tight budgets , maintaining discipline and the schools zero tolerance policy for `` everything '' . He tends to follow procedure to avoid trouble , even when it conflicts with his friendship with Hank . A highly changed person , Hank will often remind Carl of how he used to be and insinuate that Carl sold out for a position of power . He frequently rejects staff demands for better teaching aids , citing budget cuts ; he once referred to wood being used in shop class as a `` fancy teaching aid '' . Often the center of various scandals at the school , he permitted installation of soda dispensing vending machines solely for raising funds for staff vacations and purposely placed lazy students into special education classes to avoid state mandated exams ( whose grades would heavily affect school funding ) . Once when one of Dale 's plots to get rid of Moss came to nothing before they got started , Bill mentioned that Moss could n't hide behind inflated test scores forever . Coach Kleehammer ( voiced by Toby Huss ) -- Coach Kleehammer is the football coach at Tom Landry Middle School .

Kleehammer is portrayed as something of a sexist , having displayed a very negative attitude towards women 's sports . Stuart Dooley ( voiced by Mike Judge ) -- Often referred to as simply Dooley , he is Bobby 's deep - voiced , laconic classmate . He always sardonically intones something obvious after witnessing an event ( for example , to Bobby after witnessing Mega Lo Mart exploding , `` Your Dad got blown up . '' ) He also is something of a rebel -- he pulled down Peggy 's pants , and he is seen smoking . His style of speech is similar to Butt - Head from Mike Judge 's previous show , Beavis and Butt - Head , albeit without Butt - Head 's trademark giggling . Clark Peters ( voiced by Pamela Adlon ) -- The overweight bully at Tom Landry Middle School . He has a blond ponytail and speaks as though he has a perpetual head cold ( Minh once referred to him as `` that creepy booger - nosed kid '' ) .

Randy Miller ( voiced by Cheryl Holliday in 1997 -- 1999 , David Herman in 2000 -- 2009 ) -- Randy is the quintessential `` nerd '' who loves to tattle on people and then see them being punished .

Although once a somewhst prominent character , he largely vanished after the fifth season . Chane Wassonasong ( voiced by Pamela Adlon ) -- Chane is a smart but obnoxious and rude classmate of Bobby and Connie . Connie 's parents are constantly trying to fix her up with Chane , also Laotian - American , as they see him as a very preferable alternative to Bobby ( and because Chane is the son of prominent Laotian - American Ted Wassonasong , with whom they are constantly trying to curry favor ) Emily ( voiced by Ashley Johnson ) -- She is a sixth grade blonde pony - tailed hall monitor who takes her position quite seriously . She often serves as the gatekeeper of Principal Moss ' office .

He could inflate his cheeks in a manner similar to Dizzy Gillespie , and according to Cotton , he was legally blind and had to have all his teeth pulled out because they were badly decayed . In `` Death Buys a Timeshare , '' his death is confirmed as Cotton is left his estate . Topsy was apparently cremated and his remains flushed down a toilet once used by General George S. Patton , as his name can be seen along with all of Cotton 's war buddies above the toilet . Stinkey ( voiced by Edward Asner ) -- Stinkey is one of Cotton Hill 's wartime friends who was overweight and had suffered from diabetes , he died at some point later in the series as it is mentioned by Cotton and his name is among the veterans ' ashes flushed down the toilet that General Patton used .

He is a former roadie for Winger and lead singer of Big Mountain Fudgecake . In Season 9 , he began writing and performing his own children 's music . He works out of his trailer as a masseur , though his clients are generally only women . It is implied that he has a history of having sex with them , as Hank is horrified when Peggy goes to see him , and John Redcorn even states to him , `` Hank , I consider you a friend . I would never heal your wife the way I heal the wives of others . '' He is also active in American Indian rights campaigns , and Dale once helped him with a lawsuit that netted him twelve acres of land from the Federal government . However he was manipulated into building a casino on the property which was later found to be prohibited in Texas whose tribes forfeit gaming rights for federal recognition and his property was permitted for hazardous dumping to pay the debt . Because Dale had been so helpful , Redcorn felt extremely guilty over what he did with Nancy , and ended his affair by encouraging Nancy and Dale to strengthen their marriage . He eventually got back together with an ex-lover and became a dedicated husband and father to the children he had with her . Ted Wassonasong and Cindy Wassonasong ( voiced by Mike Judge and Lauren Tom respectively ) -- Ted and Cindy are affluent Laotian - American acquaintances of the Souphanousinphones . Kahn and Minh envy and resent them , but go to great lengths to gain their favor , such as inviting them over for dinner . They live in the upscale , gated community of Arlen Heights , and are prominent members of Nine Rivers Country Club . Ted and Cindy tolerate the Souphanousinphones but , in reality , look down upon them . They joined the Episcopal Church despite being Buddhist because it was `` good for business . '' Ted is also blatantly hypocritical . He referred to Kahn as a `` Banana '' ( an ethnic slur to identify an Asian American apparently lost in touch with their ethnic identity ; more comfortable with Western society ) even though Ted possesses far greater degree of luxury commodities , and lost most of his accent . He also helped pass a city ordinance banning the use of trans fats only to be immediately found consuming the very foods he helped prohibit . Octavio ( voiced by Mike Judge ) -- Octavio is a Hispanic quasi-mercenary who does various bizarre favors for Dale when paid enough money , such as breaking into the Hill 's home in the middle of the night to look for Dale 's kidney ( earlier in the episode , Hank , who was legally Dale for three days while Dale was in hospital to give his kidney to NHRA drag racer John Force , was forced to help Octavio bash his own car with re-bar to try and claim motor accident insurance , a scheme he had cook up with Dale ) . On his chest is a large Rob Zombie tattoo which he once tried to pass off as a tattoo of Jesus in order to join Luanne 's Bible study group because she was conducting lessons in her pool while wearing a two piece bikini . His appearance was modelled after actor Danny Trejo ( who actually voices Enrique on the show ) . His last appearance was a non-speaking cameo in Just Another Manic - Kahn Day . M.F. ( Milton Farnsworth ) Thatherton ( voiced by Burt Reynolds in the first appearance , Toby Huss in later appearances ) -- M.F. is a former employee of Strickland Propane and another antagonist who strikes out on his own and opens up the crooked Thatherton Fuels company across the street from Strickland . He dresses like an old school rich cowboy with a ten - gallon hat and cowboy boots . An untrustworthy type , Thatherton is a sometime foil to Hank Hill and / or Buck . His sins are similar to Buck Strickland 's ( womanizing , gambling , using people ) , but more pronounced . Thatherton openly considers customers as little more than moneymakers and hires centerfold models or Hooters girls to bait potential propane customers . Hank , who also despises him , was forced to work for Thatherton for a week due to Buck losing at a game of cards . Whenever his name is mentioned , any of the Hills remark angrily , `` Thatherton ! '' Reverend Thomason ( voiced by Maurice LaMarche ) -- A reverend at Arlen First Methodist Church . He was replaced by Reverend Karen Stroup upon retiring to start an online ministry .

She did n't take it well but there has been no talk about their relationship since that episode . Jimmy Whichard ( voiced by David Herman ) -- Jimmy is the town imbecile , and the main antagonist in `` Life in the Fast Lane - Bobby 's Saga '' . He has had several jobs , including concession manager at the racetrack and outsider artist . Dale notes that he may have given himself brain damage from staring into the sun for too long , although `` he ca n't have been too bright to do it in the first place . '' When Peggy was scammed by an internet test that `` proved '' she was a genius , she only believed it to be a scam upon learning that Jimmy was also proclaimed a genius . Chuck Mangione ( voiced by Himself ) -- Chuck is a famous jazz trumpeter and flugelhorn player , and his hit song `` Feels So Good '' is played frequently on the show . He shamelessly promotes Mega-Lo Mart until he grows tired of going to every new store opening ( he told Dale that he did n't read the contract properly , stating that Mega-Lo Mart opened 400 new stores per year and it left him no time to tour , record or be with his family ) . This forced him to disappear where Dale discovers he has become a hermit , living within the Arlen Mega-Lo Mart in a `` Toilet Paper Castle '' and stealing stocked items at night when the store is closed . When he tells Dale that he disappeared to `` stick it to the man '' , Dale decides to keep his secret and Mangione goes on living in the store undetected . Monsignor Martinez ( voiced by Mike Judge ) -- The Monsignor is the gun - toting priest hero of the fictional TV series Los Dias y Las Noches de Monsignor Martinez , a favorite of many of the principal characters . Clips of his program are often inserted into episodes as part of a running gag . In one of the episodes , Hank mentions that Martinez is an undercover cop . The clips of his episodes which appear on the series usually feature him just about to kill one of his nemeses while solemnly uttering his catchphrase , `` Vaya con Dios '' ; often preceding a melodramatic explosion . In the 8th - season episode `` Flirting with the Master , '' the actor who plays Martinez invites Peggy to Mexico City to tutor his children , and she mistakes his interest for romantic passion . A live - action pilot was filmed featuring the character , but never aired because FOX did n't think it would have been a good idea to have a show about a Catholic priest shooting people . Lane Pratley ( voiced by Dwight Yoakam in the first appearance , Dave Thomas in later appearances ) -- Lane is a sleazy car dealer who owns `` Pratley Ford '' and `` Pratley Hyundai , '' and as he says , `` I got my eye on Pratley Cadillac -- my daddy ai n't doing so good .

Mark Buckley ( voiced by David Herman ) -- Buckley was the slacker boyfriend of Luanne . He was killed in a propane explosion by his own negligence while working at Mega-Lo Mart in the second season finale , having dragged a propane tank by the valve instead of its handles resulting in leak .

Officer Brown ( voiced by Fred Willard ) -- Officer Brown is a local police officer in Arlen who is not averse to tampering with evidence and taking bribes from illegal food operations , as explained in episodes 20 and 11 ( respectively ) of season 12 . In the episode `` Cops and Roberts , '' Principal Moss states that `` Officer Brown may be a disgraced cop who tampered with evidence ... but this here used to be a man '' . His appearance is modeled after his voice actor . Brown ( as well as other Arlen police officers ) were seen to be ' starstruck ' by fictional ex-Dallas Cowboy player Willie Lane ( and his 1978 Super Bowl ring ) and refused to arrest him for felonies against Hank and Kahn after finding out who he was in the episode `` New Cowboy on the Block '' . Jack ( voiced by Brian Doyle - Murray ) -- Jack is Hank 's mentally unstable barber . Eventually , his distress affects his ability to style hair , causing Hank great embarrassment .

Miss Kremzer ( voiced by Jennifer Coolidge ) -- The teacher at the beauty school Luanne went to . She is very condescending towards Luanne in her first appearance .

Due to the No Pass No Play policy , David is prevented from playing football until he raises his grades , earning Peggy the ire of the local booster club . The club and school employees fabricate evidence that David was Learning disabled which he admitted was untrue although his grammar , handwriting and mathematical reasoning are poor . Realizing his chances for playing in professional sports are statistically low , he agrees to be tutored by Peggy to have something to fall back on . Mrs. Kalaiki - Ali'i ( voiced by Amy Hill ) -- A Hawaiian insurance agent Hank visits when Kahn backs into Hank 's truck with his van .

After the apparent failure of the Showbiz Deli , we encounter Carl again in Bad Girls , Bad Girls , Whatcha Gonna Do ? , again having switched his menu , this time to sushi , another food that can be served raw . In this later episode , it appears that Carl 's business is dong much better , as the scenes of the sushi restaurant show many customers inside .

In the car on the way home , Tammi thanked Hank and Peggy for all they have done for her . But , unfortunately , Hank is rear - ended by Alabaster , who wanted Tammi .

When Tammi requests that Hank stops the car so she can exit and return with Alabaster to Oklahoma City , Hank slams on the brakes . He steps out of the car and tells Alabaster to do likewise . Hank then hands Alabaster all of the cash Tammi gave him and states that Tammi is now his `` ho '' , making Alabaster nervous as Hank is bigger than Alabaster .

He is known for playing Yosser Hughes , the troubled ' hard man ' whose life is falling apart in Alan Bleasdale 's groundbreaking 1980s TV drama Boys from the Blackstuff and , more recently , as the Duke of Norfolk in the BBC adaptation of Dame Hilary Mantel 's Wolf Hall . He is also known for roles in blockbuster films , including Captain Edward Smith in Titanic , King Théoden in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy and Luther Plunkitt , the Warden of San Quentin Prison in the Clint Eastwood film True Crime . Contents 1 Early life 2 Career 2.1 Boys from the Blackstuff 2.2 Later roles 3 Personal life 4 Selected stage and screen credits 4.1 Theatre 4.2 Filmography 4.3 Television 5 Video games 6 References and notes 7 External links Early life ( edit ) Hill was born in Blackley , Manchester . He was brought up in a Catholic family of miners . Hill attended Xaverian College , and then Manchester Polytechnic School of Drama at the same time as Richard Griffiths . He graduated with a diploma in theatre in 1970 . Career ( edit ) In 1976 , Hill was seen as Police Constable Cluff in the Granada Television series Crown Court , the episode entitled `` The Jolly Swagmen '' Boys from the Blackstuff ( edit ) Hill first came to prominence as Yosser Hughes , a Liverpool working class man ultimately driven to the edge by an uncaring system , in Alan Bleasdale 's BBC Play for Today programme , The Black Stuff , and its series sequel , Boys from the Blackstuff . His character 's much - repeated phrase Gizza job ( `` Give us a job '' ) became popular with protesters against Margaret Thatcher 's government , because of the high unemployment of the time . Later roles ( edit ) Hill then appeared as Sergeant Putnam in Gandhi ( 1982 ) , directed by Richard Attenborough . Though Hill did not figure prominently in the cast , he benefited from being part of an Oscar - winning film . Next up for Hill was Roger Donaldson 's The Bounty ( 1984 ) , a fourth dramatisation of the famed mutiny on HMS Bounty . He had previously taken smaller parts in a number of British television dramas , appearing in the acclaimed I , Claudius in 1976 as Gratus , the no - nonsense soldier of Caligula 's bodyguard who drew Claudius from his hiding - place in the palace , and presented him as the proper heir to the empire , and also as Richard Plantagenet , Duke of York in the BBC Television Shakespeare 1982 productions of Shakespeare 's Henry VI plays . In 1985 , he played the lead role in a TV dramatisation of John Lennon 's life , A Journey in the Life . In addition to TV roles , Hill appeared on stage in The Cherry Orchard , and the title roles in Macbeth and A View from the Bridge . Hill then received critical acclaim for his performance as Joe Bradshaw in Shirley Valentine ( 1989 ) , about a Liverpool housewife ( Pauline Collins ) who was a former anti-establishment rebel and engages in an extramarital affair . Hill added more prominent films to his resume , including Mountains of the Moon ( 1990 ) , Skallagrigg ( 1994 ) and Madagascar Skin ( 1995 ) . In the mid-1990s , Hill began appearing in films more regularly . His first major role came in The Ghost and the Darkness ( 1996 ) , starring Val Kilmer as a bridge - building engineer who must trust a big game hunter ( Michael Douglas ) despite their mutual animosity ; Hill portrayed the role of Dr. Hawthorne . Hill then went down with the ship when he played Captain Edward J. Smith on the ill - fated Titanic ( 1997 ) , by James Cameron , with whom Hill got along quite well -- an experience not shared by most working on the film . Being in the then biggest grossing film of all time attracted attention to his career , as Hill became more sought - after for more prominent parts . Hill played Philos in The Scorpion King ( 2002 ) , starring Dwayne `` The Rock '' Johnson , Michael Clarke Duncan and Kelly Hu . Hill became known to a worldwide audience when he was cast in the role of King Théoden of Rohan in Peter Jackson 's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy based on Tolkien 's novel of the same name .

( November 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) History of Puerto Rico By year Pre-colonial Spanish colonial era , 1493 -- 1898 U.S. rule , 1898 - present Topics : Economic - Military - Political - Social Puerto Rico portal Map of the departments of Puerto Rico during Spanish provincial times ( 1886 ) The history of Puerto Rico began with the settlement of the archipelago of Puerto Rico by the Ortoiroid people between 3,000 and 2,000 BC . Other tribes , such as the Saladoid and Arawak Indians , populated the island between 430 BC and 1000 AD . At the time of Christopher Columbus 's arrival in the New World in 1492 , the dominant indigenous culture was that of the Taínos . The Taíno people 's numbers went dangerously low during the later half of the 16th century because of new infectious diseases carried by Europeans , exploitation by Spanish settlers , and warfare . Located in the northeastern Caribbean , Puerto Rico formed a key part of the Spanish Empire from the early years of the exploration , conquest and colonization of the New World . The island was a major military post during many wars between Spain and other European powers for control of the region in the 16th , 17th and 18th centuries . The smallest of the Greater Antilles , Puerto Rico was a stepping - stone in the passage from Europe to Cuba , Mexico , Central America , and the northern territories of South America . Throughout most of the 19th century until the conclusion of the Spanish -- American War , Puerto Rico and Cuba were the last two Spanish colonies in the New World ; they served as Spain 's final outposts in a strategy to regain control of the American continents . Realizing that it was in danger of losing its two remaining Caribbean territories , the Spanish Crown revived the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815 . The decree was printed in Spanish , English and French in order to attract Europeans , with the hope that the independence movements would lose their popularity and strength with the arrival of new settlers . Free land was offered to those who wanted to populate the islands on the condition that they swear their loyalty to the Spanish Crown and allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church . In 1898 , during the Spanish -- American War , Puerto Rico was invaded and subsequently became a possession of the United States . The first years of the 20th century were marked by the struggle to obtain greater democratic rights from the United States . The Foraker Act of 1900 , which established a civil government , and the Jones Act of 1917 , which made Puerto Ricans U.S. citizens , paved the way for the drafting of Puerto Rico 's Constitution and its approval by Congress and Puerto Rican voters in 1952 . However , the political status of Puerto Rico , a Commonwealth controlled by the United States , remains an anomaly .

Village at Macdonalds Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center in Ponce , Puerto Rico The settlement of Puerto Rico began with the establishment of the Ortoiroid culture from the Orinoco region in South America . Some scholars suggest that their settlement dates back 4000 years . An archeological dig at the island of Vieques in 1990 found the remains of what is believed to be an Ortoiroid man ( named Puerto Ferro man ) which was dated to around 2000 BC . The Ortoiroid were displaced by the Saladoid , a culture from the same region that arrived on the island between 430 and 250 BC . Between the seventh and 11th centuries , the Arawak are thought to have settled the island . During this time the Taíno culture developed , and by approximately 1000 AD , it had become dominant . Taíno culture has been traced to the village of Saladero at the basin of the Orinoco River in Venezuela ; the Taíno migrated to Puerto Rico by crossing the Lesser Antilles . At the time of Columbus ' arrival , an estimated 30 to 60 thousand Taíno Amerindians , led by the cacique ( chief ) Agüeybaná , inhabited the island . They called it `` Borinquen '' , `` the great land of the valiant and noble Lord '' . The natives lived in small villages led by a cacique and subsisted on hunting , fishing and gathering of indigenous cassava root and fruit . When the Spaniards arrived in 1493 , the Taíno were already in conflict with the raiding Carib , who were moving up the Antilles chain . The Taíno domination of the island was nearing its end , and the Spanish arrival marked the beginning of their extinction . Their culture , however , remains part of that of contemporary Puerto Rico . Musical instruments such as maracas and güiro , the hammock , and words such as Mayagüez , Arecibo , iguana , Caguas and huracán ( hurricane ) are examples of the legacy left by the Taíno . Spanish rule ( 1493 -- 1898 ) ( edit ) Beginning of colonization ( edit ) Christopher Columbus , the explorer credited with the discovery of Puerto Rico Juan Ponce de León ( Santervás de Campos , Valladolid , Spain ) , was the first governor of Puerto Rico . His grandson Juan Ponce de Leon II was the first indigenous governor of Puerto Rico . On September 24 , 1493 , Christopher Columbus set sail on his second voyage with 17 ships and 1,200 to 1,500 soldiers from Cádiz . On November 19 , 1493 he landed on the island , naming it San Juan Bautista in honor of Saint John the Baptist . The first European colony , Caparra , was founded on August 8 , 1508 by Juan Ponce de León , a lieutenant under Columbus , who was greeted by the Taíno Cacique Agüeybaná and who later became the first governor of the island . Ponce de Leon was actively involved in the Higuey massacre of 1503 in Puerto Rico . In 1508 , Sir Ponce de Leon was chosen by the Spanish Crown to lead the conquest and slavery of the Taíno Indians for gold mining operations . The following year , the colony was abandoned in favor of a nearby islet on the coast , named Puerto Rico ( Rich Port ) , which had a suitable harbor . In 1511 , a second settlement , San Germán was established in the southwestern part of the island . According to the `` 500TH Florida Discovery Council Round Table '' , on March 3 , 1513 , Juan Ponce de León , organized and commenced an expedition ( with a crew of 200 , including women and free blacks ) departing from `` Punta Aguada '' Puerto Rico . Puerto Rico was the historic first gateway to the discovery of Florida , which opened the door to the settlement of the southeastern United States . They introduced Christianity , cattle , horses , sheep , the Spanish language and more to the land ( Florida ) that later became the United States of America . This settlement occurred 107 years before the Pilgrims landed . During the 1520s , the island took the name of Puerto Rico while the port became San Juan . The Spanish settlers established the first repartimiento system , under which natives were distributed to Spanish officials to be used as slave labor . On December 27 , 1512 , under pressure from the Roman Catholic Church , Ferdinand II of Aragon issued the Burgos ' Laws , which modified the repartimiento into a system called encomiendas , aimed at ending the exploitation . The laws prohibited the use of any form of punishment toward the indigenous people , regulated their work hours , pay , hygiene , and care , and ordered them to be catechized . In 1511 , the Taínos revolted against the Spanish ; cacique Urayoán , as planned by Agüeybaná II , ordered his warriors to drown the Spanish soldier Diego Salcedo to determine whether the Spaniards were immortal . After drowning Salcedo , they kept watch over his body for three days to confirm his death . The revolt was easily crushed by Ponce de León and within a few decades much of the native population had been decimated by disease , violence , and a high occurrence of suicide . As a result , Taíno culture , language , and traditions were generally destroyed , and were claimed to have `` vanished '' 50 years after Christopher Columbus arrived . Since the early 21st century , efforts have been made to revive and rebuild Taíno culture . The Roman Catholic Church of chappel , realizing the opportunity to expand its influence , also participated in colonizing the island . On August 8 , 1511 , Pope Julius II established three dioceses in the New World , one in Puerto Rico and two on the island of Hispaniola under the archbishop of Seville . The Canon of Salamanca , Alonso Manso , was appointed bishop of the Puerto Rican diocese . On September 26 , 1512 , before his arrival on the island , the first school of advanced studies was established by the bishop . Taking possession in 1513 , he became the first bishop to arrive in the Americas . Puerto Rico would also become the first ecclesiastical headquarters in the New World during the reign of Pope Leo X and the general headquarters of the Spanish Inquisition in the New World . As part of the colonization process , African slaves were brought to the island in 1513 . Following the decline of the Taíno population , more slaves were brought to Puerto Rico ; however , the number of slaves on the island paled in comparison to those in neighboring islands . Also , early in the colonization of Puerto Rico , attempts were made to wrest control of Puerto Rico from Spain . The Caribs , a raiding tribe of the Caribbean , attacked Spanish settlements along the banks of the Daguao and Macao rivers in 1514 and again in 1521 but each time they were easily repelled by the superior Spanish firepower . However , these would not be the last attempts at control of Puerto Rico . The European powers quickly realized the potential of the newly discovered lands and attempted to gain control of them . The first school in Puerto Rico and the first school in the United States after Puerto Rico became a US territory , was the Escuela de Gramatica ( Grammar School ) . The school was established by Bishop Alonso Manso in 1513 , in the area where the Cathedral of San Juan was to be constructed . The school was free of charge and the courses taught were Latin language , literature , history , science , art , philosophy and theology . European threats ( edit ) Further information : Military history of Puerto Rico § Europeans fight over Puerto Rico View across the Bay of San Juan of Fort San Felipe del Morro Sparked by the possibility of immense wealth , many European powers made attempts to wrest control of the Americas from Spain in the 16th , 17th and 18th centuries . Success in invasion varied , and ultimately all Spanish opponents failed to maintain permanent control of the island . In 1528 , the French , recognizing the strategic value of Puerto Rico , sacked and burned the southwestern town of San Germán . They also destroyed many of the island 's first settlements , including Guánica , Sotomayor , Daguao and Loíza before the local militia forced them to retreat . The only settlement that remained was the capital , San Juan . French corsairs would again sack San Germán in 1538 and 1554 . Spain , determined to defend its possession , began the fortification of the inlet of San Juan in the early 16th century . In 1532 , construction of the first fortifications began with La Fortaleza ( the Fortress ) near the entrance to San Juan Bay . Seven years later the construction of massive defenses around San Juan began , including Fort San Felipe del Morro astride the entrance to San Juan Bay . Later , Fort San Cristóbal and Fort San Jerónimo -- built with a financial subsidy from the Mexican mines -- garrisoned troops and defended against land attacks . In 1587 , engineers Juan de Tejada and Juan Bautista Antonelli redesigned Fort San Felipe del Morro ; these changes endure . Politically , Puerto Rico was reorganized in 1580 into a captaincy general to provide for more autonomy and quick administrative responses to military threats . On November 22 , 1595 , English privateer Sir Francis Drake -- with 27 vessels and 2,500 troops -- sailed into San Juan Bay intending to loot the city . However , they were unable to defeat the forces entrenched in the forts . Knowing Drake had failed to overcome the city 's defenses by sea , on June 15 , 1598 , the Royal Navy , led by George Clifford , 3rd Earl of Cumberland , landed troops from 21 ships to the east in Santurce . Clifford and his men met Spanish resistance while attempting to cross the San Antonio bridge ( from an area known today as Condado ) into the islet of San Juan . Nonetheless , the English conquered the island and held it for several months . They were forced to abandon the island owing to an outbreak of dysentery among the troops . The following year Spain sent soldiers , cannons , and a new governor , Alonso de Mercado , to rebuild the city of San Juan . The 17th and 18th centuries saw more attacks on the island . On September 25 , 1625 , the Dutch , under the leadership of Boudewijn Hendrick ( Balduino Enrico ) , attacked San Juan , besieging Fort San Felipe del Morro and La Fortaleza . Residents fled the city but the Spanish , led by Governor Juan de Haro , were able to repel the Dutch troops from Fort San Felipe del Morro . The fortification of San Juan continued ; in 1634 , Philip IV of Spain fortified Fort San Cristóbal , along with six fortresses linked by a line of sandstone walls surrounding the city . In 1702 , the English assaulted the town of Arecibo , located on the north coast , west of San Juan , with no success . In 1797 , the French and Spanish declared war on the United Kingdom . The British attempted again to conquer the island , attacking San Juan with an invasion force of 7,000 troops and an armada consisting of 64 warships under the command of General Ralph Abercromby . Captain General Don Ramón de Castro and his army successfully resisted the attack . Amidst the constant attacks , the first threads of Puerto Rican society emerged . A 1765 census conducted by Lt. General Alejandro O'Reilly showed a total population of 44,883 , of which 5,037 ( 11.2 % ) were slaves , a low percentage compared to the other Spanish colonies in the Caribbean . In 1786 the first comprehensive history of Puerto Rico -- Historia Geográfica , Civil y Política de Puerto Rico by Fray Iñigo Abbad y Lasierra -- was published in Madrid , documenting the history of Puerto Rico from the time of Columbus ' landing in 1493 until 1783 . The book also presents a first hand account of Puerto Rican identity , including music , clothing , personality and nationality . In 1779 , Puerto Ricans fought in the American Revolutionary War under the command of Bernardo de Gálvez , who was named Field Marshal of the Spanish colonial army in North America . Puerto Ricans participated in the capture of Pensacola , the capital of the British colony of West Florida and the cities of Baton Rouge , St. Louis and Mobile . The Puerto Rican troops , commanded by Brigadier General Ramón de Castro , helped defeat the British and Indian army of 2,500 soldiers and British warships in Pensacola . Early 19th century ( edit ) See also : Captaincy General of Puerto Rico § The Early Nineteenth Century : Revolutions and setbacks , and Royal Decree of Graces of 1815 Royal Decree of Graces , 1815 , which allowed foreigners to enter Puerto Rico The 19th century brought many changes to Puerto Rico , both political and social . In 1809 , the Spanish government , in opposition to Napoleon , was convened in Cádiz in southern Spain . While still swearing allegiance to the king , the Supreme Central Junta invited voting representatives from the colonies . Ramón Power y Giralt was nominated as the local delegate to the Cádiz Cortes . The Ley Power ( `` the Power Act '' ) soon followed , which designated five ports for free commerce -- Fajardo , Mayagüez , Aguadilla , Cabo Rojo and Ponce -- and established economic reforms with the goal of developing a more efficient economy . In 1812 , the Cádiz Constitution was adopted , dividing Spain and its territories into provinces , each with a local corporation or council to promote its prosperity and defend its interests ; this granted Puerto Ricans conditional citizenship . On August 10 , 1815 , the Royal Decree of Grace was issued , allowing foreigners to enter Puerto Rico ( including French refugees from Hispaniola ) , and opening the port to trade with nations other than Spain . This was the beginning of agriculture - based economic growth , with sugar , tobacco and coffee being the main products . The Decree also gave free land to anyone who swore their loyalty to the Spanish Crown and their allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church . Thousands of families from all regions of Spain ( particularly Asturias , Catalonia , Majorca and Galicia ) , Germany , Corsica , Ireland , France , Portugal , the Canary Islands and other locations , escaping from harsh economic times in Europe and lured by the offer of free land , soon immigrated to Puerto Rico . However , these small gains in autonomy and rights were short lived . After the fall of Napoleon , absolute power returned to Spain , which revoked the Cádiz Constitution and reinstated Puerto Rico to its former condition as a colony , subject to the unrestricted power of the Spanish monarch . The integration of immigrants into Puerto Rican culture and other events changed Puerto Rican society . On June 25 , 1835 , Queen María Cristina abolished the slave trade to Spanish colonies . In 1851 , Governor Juan de la Pezuela Cevallos founded the Royal Academy of Belles Letters . The academy licensed primary school teachers , formulated school methods , and held literary contests that promoted the intellectual and literary progress of the island . In 1858 , Samuel Morse introduced wired communication to Latin America when he established a telegraph system in Puerto Rico . Morse 's oldest daughter Susan Walker Morse ( 1821 -- 1885 ) , would often visit her uncle Charles Pickering Walker who owned the Hacienda Concordia in the town of Guayama . Morse , who often spent his winters at the Hacienda with his daughter and son - in - law , who lived and owned the Hacienda Henriqueta , set a two - mile telegraph line connecting his son - in - law 's hacienda to their house in Arroyo . The line was inaugurated on March 1 , 1859 in a ceremony flanked by the Spanish and American flags . The first lines transmitted by Morse that day in Puerto Rico were : Puerto Rico , beautiful jewel ! When you are linked with the other jewels of the Antilles in the necklace of the world 's telegraph , yours will not shine less brilliantly in the crown of your Queen ! Minor slave revolts had occurred in the island during this period , However the revolt planned and organized by Marcos Xiorro in 1821 , was the most important of them all . Even though the conspiracy was unsuccessful , he achieved legendary status among the slaves and is part of Puerto Rico 's folklore . Struggle for sovereignty ( edit ) Main article : Grito de Lares The last half of the 19th century was marked by the Puerto Rican struggle for sovereignty . A census conducted in 1860 revealed a population of 583,308 . Of these , 300,406 ( 51.5 % ) were white and 282,775 ( 48.5 % ) were persons of color , the latter including people of primarily African heritage , mulattos and mestizos . The majority of the population in Puerto Rico was illiterate ( 83.7 % ) and lived in poverty , and the agricultural industry -- at the time , the main source of income -- was hampered by lack of road infrastructure , adequate tools and equipment , and natural disasters , including hurricanes and droughts . The economy also suffered from increasing tariffs and taxes imposed by the Spanish Crown . Furthermore , Spain had begun to exile or jail any person who called for liberal reforms . The Revolutionary flag of Lares `` The first Puerto Rican Flag '' used in the unsuccessful Grito de Lares ( Lares Uprising ) On September 23 , 1868 , hundreds of men and women in the town of Lares -- stricken by poverty and politically estranged from Spain -- revolted against Spanish rule , seeking Puerto Rican independence . The Grito de Lares ( `` Lares Cry '' or `` Lares Uprising '' ) was planned by a group led by Dr. Ramón Emeterio Betances , at the time exiled to the Dominican Republic , and Segundo Ruiz Belvis . Dr. Betances had founded the Comité Revolucionario de Puerto Rico ( Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico ) in January 1868 . The most important figures in the uprising were Manuel Rojas , Mathias Brugman , Mariana Bracetti , Francisco Ramírez Medina and Lola Rodríguez de Tió . The uprising , although significant , was quickly controlled by Spanish authorities . Following the Grito de Lares revolt , political and social reforms occurred toward the end of the 19th century . On June 4 , 1870 , due to the efforts of Román Baldorioty de Castro , Luis Padial and Julio Vizcarrondo , the Moret Law was approved , giving freedom to slaves born after September 17 , 1868 or over 60 years old ; on March 22 , 1873 , the Spanish National Assembly officially abolished , with a few special clauses , slavery in Puerto Rico . In 1870 , the first political organizations on the island were formed as two factions emerged . The Traditionalists , known as the Partido Liberal Conservador ( Liberal Conservative Party ) were led by José R. Fernández , Pablo Ubarri and Francisco Paula Acuña and advocated assimilation into the political party system of Spain . The Autonomists , known as the Partido Liberal Reformista ( Liberal Reformist Party ) were led by Román Baldorioty de Castro , José Julián Acosta , Nicolás Aguayo and Pedro Gerónimo Goico and advocated decentralization away from Spanish control . Both parties would later change their names to Partido Incondicional Español ( Unconditional Spanish Party ) and Partido Federal Reformista ( Reformist Federal Party ) , respectively . In March 1887 , the Partido Federal Reformista was reformed and named the Partido Autonomista Puertorriqueño ( Puerto Rican Autonomist Party ) ; it tried to create a political and legal identity for Puerto Rico while emulating Spain in all political matters . It was led by Román Baldorioty de Castro , José Celso Barbosa , Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón and Luis Muñoz Rivera . Flag flown by Fidel Vélez and his men during the `` Intentona de Yauco '' revolt Leaders of `` El Grito de Lares '' , who were in exile in New York City , joined the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee , founded on December 8 , 1895 , and continued their quest for Puerto Rican independence . In 1897 , Antonio Mattei Lluberas and the local leaders of the independence movement of the town of Yauco , organized another uprising , which became known as the `` Intentona de Yauco '' . This was the first time that the current Puerto Rican flag was unfurled in Puerto Rican soil . The local conservative political factions , which believed that such an attempt would be a threat to their struggle for autonomy , opposed such an action . Rumors of the planned event spread to the local Spanish authorities who acted swiftly and put an end to what would be the last major uprising in the island to Spanish colonial rule . The struggle for autonomy came close to achieving its goal on November 25 , 1897 , when the Carta Autonómica ( Charter of Autonomy ) , which conceded political and administrative autonomy to the island , was approved in Spain . In the past 400 - plus years , after centuries of colonial rule , Práxedes Mateo Sagasta , the Prime Minister of Spain granted the island an autonomous government on November 25 , 1897 in the empire 's legislative body in Cádiz , Spain , and trade was opened up with the United States and European colonies . The charter maintained a governor appointed by Spain , who held the power to veto any legislative decision he disagreed with , and a partially elected parliamentary structure . That same year , the Partido Autonomista Ortodoxo ( Orthodox Autonomist Party ) , led by José Celso Barbosa and Manuel Fernández Juncos , was founded . On February 9 , 1898 , the new government officially began . Local legislature set its own budget and taxes . They accepted or rejected commercial treaties concluded by Spain . In February 1898 , Governor General Manuel Macías inaugurated the new government of Puerto Rico under the Autonomous Charter which gave town councils complete autonomy in local matters . Subsequently , the governor had no authority to intervene in civil and political matters unless authorized to do so by the Cabinet . General elections were held in March and on July 17 , 1898 Puerto Rico 's autonomous government began to function , but not for long . Invasion of 1898 ( edit ) Main article : Puerto Rican Campaign In 1890 , Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan , a member of the Navy War Board and leading U.S. strategic thinker , wrote a book titled The Influence of Sea Power upon History in which he argued for the creation of a large and powerful navy modeled after the British Royal Navy . Part of his strategy called for the acquisition of colonies in the Caribbean Sea ; these would serve as coaling and naval stations , as well as strategic points of defense after construction of a canal in the Isthmus . Since 1894 , the Naval War College had been formulating plans for war with Spain and by 1896 , the Office of Naval Intelligence had prepared a plan which included military operations in Puerto Rican waters . On March 10 , 1898 , Dr. Julio J. Henna and Robert H. Todd , leaders of the Puerto Rican section of the Cuban Revolutionary Party , began to correspond with United States President William McKinley and the United States Senate in hopes that they would consider including Puerto Rico in the intervention planned for Cuba . Henna and Todd also provided the US government with information about the Spanish military presence on the island . On April 24 , Spanish Minister of Defense Segismundo Bermejo sent instructions to Spanish Admiral Cervera to proceed with his fleet from Cape Verde to the Caribbean , Cuba and Puerto Rico . In May , Lt. Henry H. Whitney of the United States Fourth Artillery was sent to Puerto Rico on a reconnaissance mission . He provided maps and information on the Spanish military forces to the US government that would be useful for an invasion . The Spanish -- American War broke out in late April . The American strategy was to seize Spanish colonies in the Atlantic -- Puerto Rico and Cuba -- and their possessions in the Pacific -- the Philippines and Guam . On May 10 , Spanish forces at Fort San Cristóbal under the command of Capt . Ángel Rivero Méndez in San Juan exchanged fire with the USS Yale under the command of Capt . William C. Wise . Two days later , on May 12 , a squadron of 12 US ships commanded by Rear Admiral William T. Sampson bombarded installations at San Juan . On June 25 , the USS Yosemite blocked San Juan harbor . On July 18 , General Nelson A. Miles , commander of US forces , received orders to sail for Puerto Rico and to land his troops . On July 21 , a convoy with nine transports and 3,300 soldiers , escorted by USS Massachusetts , sailed for Puerto Rico from Guantánamo . General Nelson Miles landed unopposed at Guánica , located in the southern coast of the island , on July 25 , 1898 , with the first contingent of American troops . Opposition was met in the southern and central regions of the island but by the end of August the island was under United States control . On August 12 , peace protocols were signed in Washington and Spanish Commissions met in San Juan on September 9 to discuss the details of the withdrawal of Spanish troops and the cession of the island to the United States . On October 1 , an initial meeting was held in Paris to draft the Peace Treaty and on December 10 , 1898 , the Treaty of Paris was signed ( ratified by the US Senate February 6 , 1899 ) . Spain renounced all claim to Cuba , ceded Guam and Puerto Rico and its dependent islets to the United States , and transferred sovereignty over the Philippines to the United States and in turn was paid $20,000,000 ( $580 million in 2016 dollars ) by the U.S. General John R. Brooke became the first United States military governor of the island . United States rule ( 1898 -- present ) ( edit ) Military government ( edit ) Raising the US Flag over San Juan , October 18 , 1898 . After the ratification of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 , Puerto Rico came under the military control of the United States of America . This brought about significant changes : the name of the island was changed to Porto Rico ( it would be changed back to Puerto Rico in 1932 ) and the currency was changed from the Puerto Rican peso to the United States dollar . Freedom of assembly , speech , press , and religion were decreed and an eight - hour day for government employees was established . A public school system was begun and the U.S. Postal service was extended to the island . The highway system was enlarged , and bridges over the more important rivers were constructed . The government lottery was abolished , cockfighting was forbidden , and a centralized public health service established . Health conditions were poor at the time , with high rates of infant mortality and numerous endemic diseases . The 45 - star flag , used by the United States during the invasion of Puerto Rico , was also the official flag of Puerto Rico from 1899 to 1908 The beginning of the military government also marked the creation of new political groups . The Partido Republicano ( Republican Party ) and the American Federal Party were created , led by José Celso Barbosa and Luis Muñoz Rivera , respectively . Both groups supported annexation by the United States as a solution to the colonial situation . The island 's Creole sugar planters , who had suffered from declining prices , hoped that U.S. rule would help them gain access to the North American market . Disaster struck in August 1899 , when two hurricanes ravaged the island : the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane on August 8 , and an unnamed hurricane on August 22 . Approximately 3,400 people died in the floods and thousands were left without shelter , food , or work . The effects on the economy were devastating : millions of dollars were lost due to the destruction of the majority of the sugar and coffee plantations . Foraker Act of 1900 ( edit ) Main article : Foraker Act The first Supreme Court of Puerto Rico , established in 1900 The military government in Puerto Rico was short lived ; it was disbanded on April 2 , 1900 , when the U.S. Congress enacted the Foraker Act ( also known as the Organic Act of 1900 ) , sponsored by Senator Joseph B. Foraker . This act established a civil government and free commerce between the island and the United States . The structure of the insular government included a governor appointed by the President of the United States , an executive council ( the equivalent of a senate ) , and a legislature with 35 members , though the executive veto required a two - thirds vote to override . The first appointed civil governor , Charles Herbert Allen , was inaugurated on May 1 , 1900 . On June 5 , President William McKinley appointed an Executive Council which included five Puerto Rican members and six U.S. members . The act also established the creation of a judicial system headed by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico and allowed Puerto Rico to send a Resident Commissioner as a representative to Congress . The Puerto Rico Department of Education was subsequently formed , headed by Martin Grove Brumbaugh ( later governor of Pennsylvania ) . Teaching was conducted entirely in English with Spanish treated as a special subject . Both languages , however , were official on the island . On November 6 , the first elections under the Foraker Act were held and on December 3 , the first Legislative Assembly took office . On March 14 , 1901 , Federico Degetau took office as the first Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico in Washington . The Foraker Act , ( with the influence of a fearful progressive ) placed a limit of 500 acres ( 2.0 km ) as the amount of land that any one person was allowed to own . This part of the act , however , was not enforced . Economic and social modernization ( edit ) The American program included building up a modern economic infrastructure that included roads , ports , electric power systems , and telephones and telegraphs , as well as hospitals and programs to develop agriculture . Sugar mill owners between the period of 1898 and 1945 turned their sugar mills into monocultural plantations in response to the economy of the 20th century . The sugar mills and tobacco , cigar , and cigarette factories gained the United States ' attention due to their fast productions and large amount of produce . Women and children were the primary workers within these industries . Puerto Rican trades went to the United States 95 % of the time . By 1914 , the coffee production that once was steady failed . The sugar industry rose along with the economy . Puerto Rican mill owners and French and Spanish residents took the United States ' corporate capital . The United States had four operations were part of the United sugar refineries that were owned by Cuba and the Dominican Republic . In 1870 , Congress made the tariff wall in order to domestic producers of sugar . This had an effect of putting sugar producers into bankruptcy . The United States acquired jurisdiction over Puerto Rico where there was free trade between the two . Capital flowed into Puerto Rico with the effect of modernizing its sugar processing mills due to the United States ' influence . The United States had formed a Tobacco Trust that had basis rules for cigarettes , but Puerto Ricans had issues when it came to brand and local marketing . The Tobacco Trust controlled cigarettes and cigar production as well as controlled the tobacco leaf . There was a fall of the industry due to the exports . During the time when sugar was not going well the coffee in the late 1800s . What changed the coffee production started when the export production replaced the farming . People lost their land and properties , the amount of land disposal shrank and the people hoped that Europe would take part in the trade of coffee , but they did not . Coffee makers were not happy with them being controlled by the United States . In 1933 most of the people worked as families instead of individuals most likely due to 90 percent of the output due to them being poor . In 1899 , the United States took over rich lands that influenced Puerto Rico 's economy that soon made Puerto Rico a state that was more capitalized in operation . There was no limit in their treads to the United States , the sugar industry had expanded and irrigation payments . The taxes Hollander Act was taxing 2 percent on rural property in 1901 . This made the people very angry and the people protested . The people were able to bring the tax down to 1 percent but this still forced landowners to sell their land . The American administrators put great emphasis on developing a modern school system . English - language instruction provoked fears of cultural genocide . This effort generated resistance from teachers , parents , politicians , intellectuals and others . Resistance to the imposition of English was part of a larger effort to resist invasion and colonization . The schools became an important arena for cultural identity , as promoted by the middle - class local teachers who rejected the idea of creating Hispanic Yankees speaking only English , and instead sought to have an autonomous Puerto Rican culture that incorporated the best of modern pedagogy and learning , with a respect for the island 's Hispanic language and cultural traditions . U.S. officials underestimated the place of Spanish in Puerto Rican culture . By 1898 Spanish was firmly rooted in the population . Spanish was also one of the leading international languages , through which Puerto Ricans were in contact with the world . It was the language in which culture was communicated . The level of opposition to the imposition of English was such that it led to the failure of U.S. language policies in Puerto Rico . One shock came in 1935 , however , when a New York study found Puerto Rican schoolchildren in New York City to be seriously deficient in basic skills . After 39 years of the imposition of English at the University of Puerto Rico , Spanish became the preferred language of instruction in 1942 , and in the public schools the vernacular of Puerto Ricans became the language of teaching and learning in 1940 -- 50 . Puerto Rico 's agricultural economy was transformed into a sugar monoculture economy , supplemented by gardens for local consumption . American sugar companies had an advantage over the local sugar plantation owners . The local plantation owner could finance his operations only at local banks which offered high interest rates , compared to the low rates that American companies received from the commercial banks in Wall Street . This factor , plus the tariffs imposed , forced many of the local sugar plantation owners to go bankrupt or to sell their holdings to the more powerful sugar companies . Sugar was considered one of the few strategic commodities in which the United States was not fully self - sufficient . Politics ( edit ) An economically evolving Puerto Rico called for a new advancement in political status . Powerful , innovative Puerto Rican leaders including Luis Muñoz Rivera , José de Diego , Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón , Manuel Zeno Gandía , Luis Lloréns Torres , Eugenio Benítez Castaño , and Pedro Franceschi contributed to the rise of multiple successful political parties . However , the birth of multiple political groups led to a diversion of the island 's interests : uniting as a statehood with the US , becoming a US territory commonwealth , or declaring independence altogether . In 1900 , the Partido Federal ( Federal Party ) was formed during the US military rule of the island after the Spanish -- American War . It was formed by Luis Munoz Rivera and other members of the Autonomist Party . The Partido Federal favored immediate transformation of Puerto Rico into an organized unincorporated territory and eventually join US statehood . The Partido Obrero Socialista de Puerto Rico ( Socialist Labor Party of Puerto Rico ) were founded by Santiago Iglesias Pantin . Overtime the Partido Obrero Socialista de Puerto Rico was also in favor of statehood with the US . The Partido Federal campaigned for assimilation into the United States and wanted to develop prosperously with their best interests under the new US administration . They wanted to fully integrate US law and government . Their plan was to become a territory and have representation through a delegate and eventually become a US state with no restrictions . The Partido Obrero Socialista de Puerto Rico did not advocate for independence . Instead party leader , Santiago Iglesias Pantin , advocated for statehood and change in economic policies which were influenced by his practice in founding the Federación Regional de Trabajadores ( Regional Workers Federation ) and labor newspaper Ensayo Obrero . The party was based on the principles of the Socialist Labor Party of America and received much support from American colonial authorities . After the dissolution of the Federal Party , Luis Muñoz Rivera and José de Diego founded the Partido Unionista de Puerto Rico ( Unionist Party of Puerto Rico ) in 1904 . The Unionist Party of Puerto Rico aimed to secure `` the right of Puerto Rico to assert its own personality , either through statehood or independence . '' The beginning of the Partido Independentista , the independence party , was in 1909 . Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón , Manuel Zeno Gandía , Luis Lloréns Torres , Eugenio Benítez Castaño , and Pedro Franceschi founded the party which was the first political party whose agenda was the independence of Puerto Rico . Another change occurred during the year the party was founded . The Olmsted Amendment changed the Foraker Act , which was designed to switch the Puerto Rican government from a military one to a government ran by the civilians . Instead , the Olmsted act called for the government to be managed solely under the executive branch . The Puerto Rican status quo was again altered in 1909 when the Foraker Act , which replaced military rule with a civilian government in Puerto Rico , was modified by the Olmsted Amendment . This amendment placed the supervision of Puerto Rican affairs in the jurisdiction of an executive department designated by the president of the United States . In 1914 , the first Puerto Rican officers , Martín Travieso ( Secretary ) and Manuel V. Domenech ( Commissioner of Interiors ) , were assigned to the Executive Cabinet . This allowed for native Puerto Ricans to hold a majority in the Council , which consisted of five members selected by the president , for the first time in history . A 1915 delegation from Puerto Rico , accompanied by the Governor Arthur Yager , traveled to Washington , D.C. to ask Congress to grant the island more autonomy . Luis Muñoz Rivera became one of the founders of the Union Party in Puerto Rico who was against the Foraker Act . This delegation and speeches made by Resident Commissioner Muñoz Rivera in Congress , coupled with political and economic interests , led to the drafting of the Jones -- Shafroth Act of 1917 ( Jones Act ) . Jones Act of 1917 ( edit ) Main article : Jones -- Shafroth Act The Jones Act was made to replace the Foraker Act , which allowed for the free entry of Puerto Rican goods into the U.S. market . The Jones Act was approved by the U.S. Congress on December 5 , 1916 , and signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson on March 2 , 1917 . Although it extended citizenship to Puerto Ricans , it was n't always welcomed . The Partido Union had opposed extension of U.S. citizenship in 1912 if it did n't make Puerto Rico a state . If they did n't become a state , U.S. citizenship would be interpreted as an attempt to block independence of the Puerto Ricans . For them , the promise of citizenship did n't affirm the promise of statehood , it excluded any considerations of independence . The act made Puerto Rico an `` organized but unincorporated '' United States territory , much like a colony . Puerto Ricans were also collectively given a restricted U.S. citizenship . This implied that Puerto Ricans residing on the island did not have full American citizenship rights , such as the right to vote for the President of the United States . As U.S. citizens , conscription could be extended to the island . A few months later , 20,000 Puerto Rican soldiers were sent to the United States Army during the First World War . The Act also divided governmental powers into three branches : an executive ( appointed by the President of the United States ) , legislative , and judicial branch . The legislative branch was composed of the Senate , consisting of nineteen members , and a House of Representatives , consisting of 39 members . Legislators were freely elected by the Puerto Rican people . A bill of rights , which established elections to be held every four years , was also created . Though the act created a more structured government for the island , the United States Congress still held the right to veto or amend bills and laws passed by the territorial legislature . In addition to veto power , the United States could prevent the enforcing of actions taken by the legislature . The Act stated that the President of the United States was to appoint members of the Puerto Rico 's legislative branch , as well as the directors of the six major government departments - agriculture and labor , health , interior , and treasury ( with the advisement of Congress ) and the Attorney General and the commissioner of education . The Act also made English the official language of the Puerto Rican courts , government , and the public education systems . Destruction left from the hurricane in Mayaguez , Puerto Rico 1918 On October 11 , 1918 , an earthquake occurred , with an approximate magnitude of 7.3 on the Richter scale , accompanied by a tsunami reaching 6.1 metres ( 20 ft ) in height . The epicenter was located northwest of Aguadilla in the Mona Passage ( between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic ) . This earthquake caused great damage and loss of life at Mayagüez , and lesser damage along the west coast . Tremors continued for several weeks . Approximately 116 casualties were reported resulting from the earthquake and 40 from the tsunami . Some politicians were in favor of Puerto Rico becoming an incorporated state of the U.S. , while others wanted Puerto Rico to gain independence from the United States . Amid this debate , a nationalist group emerged that encouraged radical activism for Puerto Rico to become independent from the United States . As a consequence of the Jones Act and the establishment of elections , a new political party , the Partido Nacionalista de Puerto Rico ( Puerto Rican Nationalist Party ) , was founded on September 17 , 1922 . This party used advocated massive demonstrations and protests against any political activity that was not going to result in Puerto Rico gaining independence . In 1924 , Pedro Albizu Campos joined the party and later became the vice president in 1927 . In 1930 , Albizu was elected president . Being the president , he instilled many of his political ideologies into the party which was composed heavily of anticolonial politics and feelings of contempt against the United States . In the 1930s , the Nationalist Party , led by president Pedro Albizu Campos failed to attract sufficient electoral support and withdrew from political participation . Increased conflict arose between their adherents and the authorities . On October 20 , 1935 Albizu testified against the dean of the University of Puerto Rico , claiming that he wanted to Americanize the institution . Four days later a student assembly gathered and declared Albizu a persona non grata , forbidding him to speak there . Albizu was later arrested and convicted of conspiring to overthrow the American government . He was arrested for breaking the Smith Act of 1940 which declared that it was against the law for anyone to teach or be part of a group that encouraged the overthrow of the American government . On October 23 , 1935 , a student assembly was planned to be held at the University of Puerto Rico - Río Piedras campus . Its officials asked Governor Blanton Winship to provide armed police officers for the campus , to forestall possible violence . Colonel Elisha Francis Riggs , the U.S. appointed Police Chief , commanded the forces . A couple of police officers spotted what they believed to be a suspicious - looking automobile and asked the driver Ramón S. Pagán for his license . Pagán was the Secretary of the Nationalist Party at this time . He was accompanied in the car by his friends and other Nationalist Party members Pedro Quiñones and Eduardo Rodríguez . The police officers asked Pagán to slowly drive to the police station on Calle Arzuaga , but a block from the station , the police surrounded the vehicle and fired their guns into the car . Pagán , Quiñones , and Rodríguez were not armed with weapons . José Santiago Barea , another Nationalist , was approaching the car when police began shooting . It resulted in the death of the four nationalists and one bystander . In retaliation for the `` Río Piedras massacre '' at the University of Rio Piedras , on February 23 , 1936 , Nationalists Hiram Rosado and Elias Beauchamp killed Colonel E. Francis Riggs in San Juan . They were taken into custody where they were killed by policemen and officers while being held at the San Juan headquarters . Rosado and Beauchamp were declared heroes by the Nationalist Party president , Pedro Albizu - Campos . Shortly after , the San Juan Federal Court had Albizu arrested for his incitement of discontent . After initially being found innocent in a jury with seven Puerto Ricans and two North Americans , the judge ordered a new jury which had ten North Americans and two Puerto Ricans , who found him guilty . On July 31 , 1936 , Albizu and several other Nationalists such as Juan Antonio Corretjer and Clemente Soto Vélez were convicted of being associated with Riggs ' murder . They were sentenced to six to 10 years in a federal prison in the United States . Picture by journalist Carlos Torres Morales of the Ponce massacre , March 21 , 1937 External audio You may watch newsreel scenes of the Ponce massacre here . On March 21 , 1937 , a peaceful march was organized by the Nationalist Party , under Pedro Alibizu Campos , to commemorate the ending of slavery in Puerto Rico in 1873 by the governing Spanish National Assembly . The police , under the orders of General Blanton Winship , the US - appointed colonial Governor of Puerto Rico , opened fire at the peaceful Puerto Rican Nationalist Party parade , which is now known as the `` Ponce massacre '' : 20 unarmed people ( including two policemen ) were killed , with wounded persons ranging between 100 -- 200 . This occurred because the head of the police force in Juana Díaz , Guillermo Soldevila , raised a whip and struck the chest of Tomás Lopez de Victoria , the captain of the cadet corps , and told him to stop the march . As a result , a police officer , Armando Martinez , ran from the corner in front of the Nationalist council and fired once into the air . This prompted many others to fire their arms . On July 25 , 1938 , a little over a year after the Ponce massacre , Governor Winship ordered a military parade take place in the city of Ponce in celebration of the American invasion of Puerto Rico . Such celebrations customarily took place in San Juan , the capital of the colonial government . At the parade , an attempt was made to assassinate Winship , allegedly by members of the Nationalist Party . It was the first time in Puerto Rico 's long history that an attempt had been made against a governor . Although Winship escaped unscathed , a total of 36 people were wounded , including a colonel in the National Guard and the Nationalist gunman . Establishment of the Commonwealth ( edit ) From 1948 to 1952 it was a felony to display the Puerto Rican flag in public ; the only flag permitted to be flown on the island was the flag of the United States . In the years after World War II , social , political and economical changes began to take place that have continued to shape the island 's character today . The late 1940s brought the beginning of a major migration to the continental United States , mainly to New York City . The main reasons for this were an undesirable economic situation brought by the Great Depression , as well as strong recruiting by the U.S. armed forces for personnel and U.S. companies for workers . In 1946 President Truman appointed Resident Commissioner Jesús T. Piñero to serve as island governor ; he was the first Puerto Rican appointed to that position . On June 10 , 1948 , Piñero signed the infamous `` Ley de la Mordaza '' ( Gag Law ) . Law 53 , as it was officially known , was passed by the Puerto Rican legislature presided by Luis Muñoz Marín on May 21 , 1948 . The Law made it illegal to display the Puerto Rican flag , sing a nationalist song , talk about independence or to campaign for the independence of the island . It resembled the anti-communist Smith Law passed in the United States . The U.S. Congress passed an act allowing Puerto Ricans to elect their governor , and the first elections under this act were held on November 2 , 1948 . Luis Muñoz Marín , president of the Puerto Rican Senate , successfully campaigned and became the first democratically elected Governor of the island on January 2 , 1949 . El Imparcial headline : `` Aviation ( US ) bombs Utuado '' during Nationalist revolts On July 4 , 1950 , President Harry S. Truman signed Public Act 600 , which allowed Puerto Ricans to draft their own constitution establishing their own internal government structures ; it also renamed the body politic as the `` Commonwealth of Puerto Rico . '' in English and `` Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico '' in Spanish . ( The Commonwealth designation was similar to the bodies politic of the states of Massachusetts , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Kentucky . ) Once in office , Muñoz Marin did not pursue Puerto Rican Independence , which angered some of his constituency . On October 30 , 1950 , a group of Puerto Rican nationalists , led by Pedro Albizu Campos , staged several local attacks , known as the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party revolts of the 1950s , the most successful of which is known as the Jayuya Uprising . The revolts included an attack on the governor 's mansion , La Fortaleza . Puerto Rican military forces were called in to put down the Jayuya Uprising . Two days later , two Nationalists from New York tried to storm in to Blair House , then the president 's temporary residence , to assassinate United States President Harry S. Truman . These acts led Muñoz to crack down on Puerto Rican nationalists and advocates of Puerto Rican independence . The actions by both Muñoz and the United States ' Government would later be determined as infringing on constitutional rights . In February 1952 , the Constitution of Puerto Rico was approved by voters in a referendum , and a federal law approved it , subject to striking Sec. 20 of Article II and adding text to Sec. 3 of Article VII of the final draft , amendments that were finally ratified in November of that year . The island organized as the Estado Libre Asociado ( Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ) . That same year marked the first time that the Flag of Puerto Rico could be publicly displayed , after having been criminalized in 1948 by the Popular Democratic Party - controlled government . In March 1954 , four Nationalists fired guns from the visitors gallery in the US House of Representatives at the Capitol , to protest the lack of Puerto Rican independence , wounding several persons . Luis A. Ferré founded Estadistas Unidos ( United Statehooders ) , an organization to campaign for statehood in the 1967 plebiscite , after the Statehood Republican Party chose to boycott the vote . On July 23 , 1967 , the first plebiscite on the political status of Puerto Rico was held . Voters affirmed continuation of Commonwealth status ( Commonwealth -- 60.4 % Statehood -- 39 % ; Independence -- 0.6 % ) . Other plebiscites have been held to determine the political status of Puerto Rico , in 1993 and in 1998 . Both times , although by smaller margins , the status quo has been upheld . In 2012 , a majority voted to reject the current status and voted to become a state . The referendum was controversial as opponents had tried to persuade people to abstain from voting altogether and argued the vote was invalid . As the U.S. Constitution empowers Congress to admit new states , the referendum could be taken only as a sign of popular opinion . Legally the island remains a territory of the United States , under congressional supervision . After the 1967 plebiscite , the Partido Nuevo Progresista ( New Progressive Party or New Party for Progress ) was organized under Ferré 's leadership . The party campaigned for Puerto Rico to become the 51st state of the Union . Luis A. Ferré was elected governor on November 5 , 1968 , with 43.6 % of the vote , the first time a pro-statehood governor had received a plurality . The New Progressive Party , the Popular Democratic Party , and the Independence Party constitute the current political status - based registered political parties in the island . Puerto Rico continues to struggle to define its political status . Even though Puerto Rico was granted the right to draft its own Constitution , approved conditionally by Congress on July 3 , 1952 , it remains an unincorporated organized territory of the United States . Its ambiguous status continues to spark political debates which dominate Puerto Rican society . Statehood issue ( edit ) On July 23 , 1967 , the first plebiscite on the political status of Puerto Rico was held . Voters overwhelmingly affirmed continuation of Commonwealth status ( with 60.4 % voting to remain a commonwealth , 39 % voting to work towards statehood ) . Other referendums have been subsequently held to determine the political status of Puerto Rico , in 1993 and in 1998 . In all three of these , the status quo has been upheld ; there was no strong feeling in favor of independence or statehood . The Puerto Rican status referendum , 2012 occurred on November 6 , 2012 . The result a 54 % majority of the ballots cast against the continuation of the island 's territorial political status , and in favor of a new status . Of votes for new status , a 61.1 % majority chose statehood . This was by far the most successful referendum for statehood advocates . In all earlier referenda , votes for statehood were matched almost equally by votes for remaining an American territory , with the remainder for independence . Support for U.S. statehood has risen in each successive popular referendum . Because there were almost 500,000 blank ballots in the 2012 referendum , creating confusion as to the voters ' true desire , Congress decided to ignore the vote . The Puerto Rican status referendum , 2017 occurred on June 11 , 2017 . While initially the referendum would only have the options of statehood and independence / free association , a letter from the Trump administration recommended to add the Commonwealth , the current status , in the plebiscite . The option had been removed from this plebiscite in response to the results of the plebiscite in 2012 which asked whether to remain in the current status and No had won . However , the Trump administration cited changes in demographics during the past 5 years to add the option once again . Amendments to the plebiscite bill were adopted making ballot wording changes requested by the U.S. Department of Justice , as well as adding a `` current territorial status '' option . Governor Ricardo Rosselló is strongly in favor of statehood to help develop the economy and help to `` solve our 500 - year - old colonial dilemma ... Colonialism is not an option ... It 's a civil rights issue ... 3.5 million citizens seeking an absolute democracy , '' he told the news media . Benefits of statehood include an additional $10 billion per year in federal funds , the right to vote in presidential elections , higher Social Security and Medicare benefits , and a right for its government agencies and municipalities to file for bankruptcy . The latter is currently prohibited . Regardless of the outcome of the referendum , action by the United States Congress would be necessary to implement changes to the status of Puerto Rico under the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution . Hurricanes ( edit ) While the eye of Category 5 Hurricane Irma passed north of the island on September 5 , 2017 , winds were sufficient to leave 1 million citizens without power . On September 20 , 2017 , Hurricane Maria hit the island directly , destroying infrastructure including most homes , all electricity , most potable water supplies , transportation , and communication . Economic History ( edit ) Coffee was a major industry before the 1940s . Arabica beans were introduced to the island in 1736 . Production soared in the central mountainous area after 1855 because of cheap land , a low - paid and plentiful workforce , good credit facilities , and a growing market in the U.S. , Spain and Europe . Decline set in after 1897 , and the end came with a major hurricane in 1928 and the 1930s depression . While coffee declined , sugar and tobacco grew in importance , thanks to the large mainland market . The island 's social and economic structure modernized after 1898 , with new infrastructure such as roads , ports , railroads and telegraph lines , and new public health measures . The high infant mortality death rate of the late 19th century declined steadily , thanks in large measure to basic public health programs . Land tenure did not become concentrated in fewer hands , but incomes increased as American agribusiness and capital investments arrived . The land tenure system in the firm control of local farmers ( small , medium , and large ) . After 1940 dairying became an industry second only to sugar , and had a higher dollar output than the better - known traditional crops -- coffee and tobacco . In the 1920s , the economy of Puerto Rico boomed . A dramatic increase in the price of sugar , Puerto Rico 's principal export , brought cash to the farmers . As a result , the island 's infrastructure was steadily upgraded . New schools , roads and bridges were constructed . The increase in private wealth was reflected in the erection of many residences , while the development of commerce and agriculture stimulated the extension of banking and transport facilities . This period of prosperity came to an end in 1929 with the onset of the Great Depression . At the time , agriculture was the main contributor to the economy . Industry and commerce slowed during the 1930s as well . The problems were aggravated when on September 27 , 1932 , Hurricane San Ciprián struck the island . Exact figures of the destruction are not known but estimates say that 200 -- 300 people were killed , more than a thousand were injured , and property damage escalated to $30 -- 50 million ( $530 million to $880 million as of 2016 ) . The agricultural production , the principal economic driver for the island , came to a standstill . Under President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal , a Puerto Rican Reconstruction Administration was authorized . Funds were made available for construction of new housing , infrastructure , including transportation improvements and other capital investment to improve island conditions . In 1938 , a new federal minimum wage law was passed , establishing it at 25 cents an hour . As a consequence , two - thirds of the island 's textile factories closed because they could not be profitable while paying workers at that level . Since 1945 ( edit ) After World War II , large numbers of young people migrated to the mainland 's industrial cities for work and remitted dollars back to their families . In 1950 Washington introduced Operation Bootstrap , which greatly stimulated economic growth from 1950 until the 1970s . Due to billions of dollars of corporate investments , the growth rate was 6 % for the 1950s , 5 % for the 1960s , and 4 % for the 1970s . Puerto Rico became one of the most affluent economies in Latin America . However , it had to import 80 % of its food . Operation Bootstrap was sponsored by governor Muñoz Marín . It was coupled with agrarian reform ( land redistribution ) that limited the area that could be held by large sugarcane interests . Operation Bootstrap enticed US mainland investors to transfer or create manufacturing plants by granting them local and federal tax concessions , but maintaining the access to mainland markets free of import duties . Another incentive was the lower wage scales in the densely populated island . The program accelerated the shift from an agricultural to an industrial society . The 1950s saw the development of labor - intensive light industries , such as textiles ; later manufacturing gave way to heavy industry , such as petrochemicals and oil refining , in the 1960s and 1970s . Muñoz Marín 's development programs brought some prosperity for an emergent middle class . The industrialization was in part fueled by generous local incentives and freedom from federal taxation , while providing access to continental US markets without import duties . As a result , a rural agricultural society was transformed into an industrial working class . Manufacturing activity , however , has been burdened by electricity rates two to three times the average in the United States . External audio Newsreel scenes in Spanish of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s are here . In 2005 , protests over the noise of bombing practice forced the closure of Roosevelt Roads Naval Station . This resulted in a loss of 6,000 jobs and an annual decrease in income of $300 million . In 2006 , Puerto Rico saw its credit rating downgraded to one notch above non-investment grade by the main credit rating agencies , with the possibility of more downgrades happening in the near future . This has led to fiscal measures to reduce government spending , increase revenues and balance the budget , and the implementation in 2006 and expansion in 2013 of a 7 % sales tax . Present - day Puerto Rico has become a major tourist destination and a leading pharmaceutical and manufacturing center , as well as a major financial center for the Caribbean . In early 2017 , the Puerto Rican government - debt crisis posed serious problems for the government which was saddled with outstanding bond debt that had climbed to $70 billion or $12,000 per capita at a time with a 45 percent poverty rate and 12.4 % unemployment that is more than twice the mainland U.S. average . The debt had been increasing during a decade long recession . The Commonwealth had been defaulting on many debts , including bonds , since 2015 . `` Without action before April , Puerto Rico 's ability to execute contracts for Fiscal Year 2018 with its managed care organizations will be threatened , thereby putting at risk beginning July 1 , 2017 the health care of up to 900,000 poor U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico '' , according to a letter sent to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human Services . They also said that `` Congress must enact measures recommended by both Republicans and Democrats that fix Puerto Rico 's inequitable health care financing structure and promote sustained economic growth . '' Initially , the oversight board created under PROMESA called for Puerto Rico 's governor Ricardo Rosselló to deliver a fiscal turnaround plan by January 28 . Just before that deadline , the control board gave the Commonwealth government until February 28 to present a fiscal plan ( including negotiations with creditors for restructuring debt ) to solve the problems . A moratorium on lawsuits by debtors was extended to May 31 . It is essential for Puerto Rico to reach restructuring deals to avoid a bankruptcy - like process under PROMESA . In May 2017 , after Puerto Rico 's water system was massively damaged by Hurricane Maria , the Natural Resources Defense Council , a non-profit international environmental advocacy group , reported that Puerto Rico 's potable water system was the worst as measured by the Safe Drinking Water Act , with 70 % of the population living with water that violated U.S. law .

Puerto Rico has independent tax - levying authority by provisions of 48 U.S.C. § 734 of the United States code . Contents ( hide ) 1 Federal taxes 2 Commonwealth taxes 2.1 Sales tax 3 See also 4 References Federal taxes ( edit ) The Commonwealth government has its own tax laws and Puerto Ricans are also required to pay most US federal taxes , with the major exception being that most residents do not have to pay the federal personal income tax . In 2009 , Puerto Rico paid $3.742 billion into the US Treasury . Residents of Puerto Rico pay into Social Security , and are thus eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement . However , they are excluded from the Supplemental Security Income . The federal taxes paid by Puerto Rico residents include import / export taxes , federal commodity taxes , and others . Residents also pay federal payroll taxes , such as Social Security and Medicare taxes . Only certain residents of Puerto Rico are required to file federal income tax forms . According to the Internal Revenue Service : In general , United States citizens and resident aliens who are bona fide residents of Puerto Rico during the entire tax year , which for most individuals is January 1 to December 31 , are only required to file a U.S. federal income tax return if they have income sources outside of Puerto Rico or if they are employees of the U.S. government . Bona fide residents of Puerto Rico generally do not report income received from sources within Puerto Rico on their U.S. income tax return . However , they should report all income received from sources outside Puerto Rico on their U.S. income tax return . Residents of Puerto Rico who are employed by the government of the United States or who are members of the armed forces of the United States also should report all income received for their services to the government of the United States on their U.S. income tax return . United States citizens or resident aliens who are not bona fide residents of Puerto Rico during the entire tax year are required to report all income from whatever source derived on their U.S. income tax return . However , a U.S. citizen who changes residence from Puerto Rico to the United States and who was a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico at least two years before changing residence can exclude from U.S. taxable income the Puerto Rican source income received while residing in Puerto Rico during the taxable year of such change of residence . Bona fide residents of Puerto Rico can not claim deductions and / or credits allocable to or chargeable against Puerto Rican source income that is excluded from a U.S. tax return . The deductions and credits not attributable to specific income must be divided between excluded income from sources in Puerto Rico and income from all other sources to find the part that can be deducted or credited on a U.S. tax return . Examples of deductions not attributable to specific income include alimony , the standard deduction , and certain itemized deductions such as medical expenses , charitable contributions , and real estate taxes and mortgage interest on your personal residence . Personal exemptions are generally allowed in full . If you have taxable Puerto Rican source income on your U.S. income tax return , then you can claim a credit for foreign taxes paid to Puerto Rico . However , you are not allowed to claim a credit for foreign taxes paid with respect to Puerto Rican source income that is excluded from a U.S. tax return . Therefore , to properly calculate your foreign tax credit , you must reduce your foreign taxes paid by the amount of taxes allocable to excluded Puerto Rican source income . Employers in Puerto Rico are subject to both Federal Insurance Contributions Act ( FICA ) tax ( a payroll withholding tax , which funds Social Security and Medicare ) and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act ( FUTA ) . Employers in Puerto Rico must withhold the employee portion of FICA taxes from their employees ' wages and contribute the employer portion of FICA . Commonwealth taxes ( edit ) Main article : Internal Revenue Code ( Puerto Rico ) Puerto Rico imposes a separate income tax in lieu of federal income tax . All federal employees , those who do business with the federal government , Puerto Rico - based corporations that intend to send funds to the US , and some others also pay federal income taxes ( for example , Puerto Rican residents who are members of the US military , and Puerto Rico residents who earned income from sources outside Puerto Rico ) . In addition , because the cutoff point for income taxation is lower than that of the US IRS code , and the per - capita income in Puerto Rico is much lower than the average per - capita income on the mainland , more Puerto Rico residents pay income taxes to the local taxation authority than if the IRS code were applied to the island . That occurs because `` the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government has a wider set of responsibilities than do U.S. State and local governments . '' As residents of Puerto Rico pay into Social Security , Puerto Ricans are eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement but are excluded from the Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) ( Commonwealth of Puerto Rico residents , unlike residents of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and residents of the 50 States , do not receive the SSI ) , and the island actually receives less than 15 % of the Medicaid funding it would normally receive if it were a state . However , Medicare providers receive less - than - full state - like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in Puerto Rico even though the latter paid fully into the system In general , `` many federal social welfare programs have been extended to Puerto Rican ( sic ) residents , although usually with caps inferior to those allocated to the states . '' A common misconception is that the import / export taxes collected by the U.S. on products manufactured in Puerto Rico are all returned to the Puerto Rico Treasury . That is not the case , as such import / export taxes are returned only for rum products , and even then , the US Treasury keeps a portion of the taxes . The main body of domestic statutory tax law in Puerto Rico is the Internal Revenue Code of Puerto Rico ( Spanish : Código de Rentas Internas de Puerto Rico ) . The code organizes commonwealth laws covering commonwealth income tax , payroll taxes , gift taxes , estate taxes and statutory excise taxes . Sales tax ( edit ) Main article : Puerto Rico Sales and Use Tax On July 4 , 2006 , the government approved Law Number 117 , The 2006 Contributive Justice Law , establishing a tax with a 5.5 % rate at state level and an optional 1.5 % rate at municipal level . The tax went into effect on November 15 , 2006 . The tax is better known as the Sales and Use Tax ' ( Impuesto sobre Ventas y Uso ) , often referred to by its Spanish acronym `` IVU '' . The law amended Article B of the Code and created subarticle BB . On July 29 , 2007 , the government approved Law Number 80 , making the tax mandatory for all municipalities of the island . Also , the tax rates changed to 6 % at the state level and 1 % at the municipal level . The tax originated in some municipalities ( Caguas , Yauco and Villalba ) in 2005 . Seeing the economic success of these municipalities , many other municipalities enacted sales tax ordinances , usually by copying the ordinance of Caguas . By the middle of 2006 , more than 30 municipalities had enacted sales and uses taxes on the island . During the second and third quarters of 2006 , the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico suffered several political struggles in its Legislative Assembly . They were largely caused of the budget deficit of the government and the refusal of the Legislative Assembly to approve the taxes proposed by the Governor of the Island . Government offices were shut down until the Assembly approved Law 117 , which included the first sales tax of that possession of the United States . On July 1 , 2006 , the first Commonwealth - wide sales tax was approved with a 5.5 % rate at state level and an optional 1.5 % rate at municipal level . The adoption of the municipal tax was mixed . The tax went into effect on November 15 , 2006 . Since the tax reform of July 2007 , the tax is applied in all 78 municipalities of the island and at Commonwealth level . On February 6 , 2008 , the governor of the island proposed to remove the state part of the IVU . Also , with the February 6 , 2008 changes , the tax rates are now 6 % at the state level and 1 % at the municipal level . On July 1 , 2015 , the sales tax rate was increased to 11.5 % , in response to the island 's suffering economy . The new tax contributes 1 % to the municipality and 10.5 % to the state . The IVU was scheduled to expire on April 1 , 2016 , to be replaced with a value - added tax ( VAT ) of 10.5 % for the state level , with the 1 % IVU continuing for the municipalities . On 2 May 2016 the House of Representatives voted to repeal the adoption of value added tax ( VAT ) , followed shortly by the Senate on 5 May 2016 . The Legislature has decided to continue the existing Sales and Use Taxation ( SUT ) system .

It has , for example , been applied to both states and territories . When used in connection with areas under U.S. sovereignty that are not states , the term broadly describes an area that has a constitution of its adoption . Puerto Rico ( Spanish for `` Rich Port '' ) , officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ( Spanish : Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico , lit . `` Free Associated State of Puerto Rico '' ) and briefly called Porto Rico , is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea . An archipelago among the Greater Antilles , Puerto Rico includes the main island of Puerto Rico and a number of smaller ones , such as Mona , Culebra , and Vieques . The capital and most populous city is San Juan . Its official languages are Spanish and English , though Spanish predominates . The island 's population is approximately 3.4 million . Puerto Rico 's history , tropical climate , natural scenery , traditional cuisine , and tax incentives make it a destination for travelers from around the world . Originally populated by the indigenous Taíno people , the island was claimed in 1493 by Christopher Columbus for Spain during his second voyage . Later it endured invasion attempts from the French , Dutch , and British . Four centuries of Spanish colonial government influenced the island 's cultural landscapes with waves of African slaves , Canarian , and Andalusian settlers . In the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary , but strategic role when compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and the mainland parts of New Spain . Spain 's distant administrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century , helping to produce a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined elements from the Native Americans , Africans , and Iberians . In 1898 , following the Spanish -- American War , the United States acquired Puerto Rico under the terms of the Treaty of Paris . The treaty took effect on April 11 , 1899 . Puerto Ricans are by law natural - born citizens of the United States and may move freely between the island and the mainland . As it is not a state , Puerto Rico does not have a vote in the United States Congress , which governs the territory with full jurisdiction under the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950 . However , Puerto Rico does have one non-voting member of the House called a Resident Commissioner . As a U.S. territory , American citizens residing in Puerto Rico are disenfranchised at the national level and do not vote for president and vice president of the United States , and do not pay federal income tax on Puerto Rican income . Like other territories and the District of Columbia , Puerto Rico does not have U.S. senators . Congress approved a local constitution , allowing U.S. citizens on the territory to elect a governor . A 2012 referendum showed a majority ( 54 % of those who voted ) disagreed with `` the present form of territorial status '' . A second question asking about a new model , had full statehood the preferred option among those who voted for a change of status , although a significant number of people did not answer the second question of the referendum . Another fifth referendum was held on June 11 , 2017 , with `` Statehood '' and `` Independence / Free Association '' initially as the only available choices . At the recommendation of the Department of Justice , an option for the `` current territorial status '' was added . The referendum showed an overwhelming support for statehood , with 97.18 % voting for it , although the voter turnout had a historically low figure of only 22.99 % of the registered voters casting their ballots . In early 2017 , the Puerto Rican government - debt crisis posed serious problems for the government . The outstanding bond debt had climbed to $70 billion at a time with 12.4 % unemployment . The debt had been increasing during a decade long recession . This was the second major financial crisis to affect the island after the Great Depression when the U.S. government , in 1935 , provided relief efforts through the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration . On May 3 , 2017 , Puerto Rico 's financial oversight board in the U.S. District Court for Puerto Rico filed the debt restructuring petition which was made under Title III of PROMESA . By early August 2017 , the debt was $72 billion with a 45 % poverty rate . In late September 2017 , Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico causing devastating damage . The island 's electrical grid was largely destroyed , with repairs expected to take months to complete , provoking the largest power outage in American history . Recovery efforts were somewhat slow in the first few months , and over 200,000 residents had moved to Florida alone by late November 2017 .

Puerto Ricans often call the island Borinquén -- a derivation of Borikén , its indigenous Taíno name , which means `` Land of the Valiant Lord '' . The terms boricua and borincano derive from Borikén and Borinquen respectively , and are commonly used to identify someone of Puerto Rican heritage . The island is also popularly known in Spanish as la isla del encanto , meaning `` the island of enchantment '' . Columbus named the island San Juan Bautista , in honor of Saint John the Baptist , while the capital city was named Ciudad de Puerto Rico ( `` Rich Port City '' ) . Eventually traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico , while San Juan became the name used for the main trading / shipping port and the capital city . The island 's name was changed to `` Porto Rico '' by the United States after the Treaty of Paris of 1898 . The anglicized name was used by the U.S. government and private enterprises . The name was changed back to Puerto Rico by a joint resolution in Congress introduced by Félix Córdova Dávila in 1931 . The official name of the entity in Spanish is Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico ( `` free associated state of Puerto Rico '' ) , while its official English name is Commonwealth of Puerto Rico . History Main article : History of Puerto Rico Pre-columbian era A reconstructed Taíno village at the Tibes Ceremonial Center The ancient history of the archipelago which is now Puerto Rico is not well known . Unlike other indigenous cultures in the New World ( Aztec , Maya and Inca ) which left behind abundant archeological and physical evidence of their societies , scant artifacts and evidence remain of the Puerto Rico 's indigenous population . Scarce archaeological findings and early Spanish accounts from the colonial era constitute all that is known about them . The first comprehensive book on the history of Puerto Rico was written by Fray Íñigo Abbad y Lasierra in 1786 , nearly three centuries after the first Spaniards landed on the island . The first known settlers were the Ortoiroid people , an Archaic Period culture of Amerindian hunters and fishermen who migrated from the South American mainland . Some scholars suggest their settlement dates back about 4,000 years . An archeological dig in 1990 on the island of Vieques found the remains of a man , designated as the `` Puerto Ferro Man '' , which was dated to around 2000 BC . The Ortoiroid were displaced by the Saladoid , a culture from the same region that arrived on the island between 430 and 250 BC . The Igneri tribe migrated to Puerto Rico between 120 and 400 AD from the region of the Orinoco river in northern South America . The Arcaico and Igneri co-existed on the island between the 4th and 10th centuries . Between the 7th and 11th centuries , the Taíno culture developed on the island . By approximately 1000 AD , it had become dominant . At the time of Columbus ' arrival , an estimated 30,000 to 60,000 Taíno Amerindians , led by the cacique ( chief ) Agüeybaná , inhabited the island . They called it Boriken , meaning `` the great land of the valiant and noble Lord '' . The natives lived in small villages , each led by a cacique . They subsisted by hunting and fishing , done generally by men , as well as by the women 's gathering and processing of indigenous cassava root and fruit . This lasted until Columbus arrived in 1493 . Spanish colony ( 1493 -- 1898 ) Further information : Captaincy General of Puerto Rico Juan Ponce de León ( Santervás de Campos , Valladolid , Spain ) , Puerto Rico 's first governor Conquest and early settlement When Columbus arrived in Puerto Rico during his second voyage on November 19 , 1493 , the island was inhabited by the Taíno . They called it Borikén ( Borinquen in Spanish transliteration ) . Columbus named the island San Juan Bautista , in honor of St John the Baptist . Having reported the findings of his first travel , Columbus brought with him this time a letter from King Ferdinand empowered by a papal bull that authorized any course of action necessary for the expansion of the Spanish Empire and the Christian faith . Juan Ponce de León , a lieutenant under Columbus , founded the first Spanish settlement , Caparra , on August 8 , 1508 . He later served as the first governor of the island . Eventually , traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico , and San Juan became the name of the main trading / shipping port . At the beginning of the 16th century , the Spanish people began to colonize the island . Despite the Laws of Burgos of 1512 and other decrees for the protection of the indigenous population , some Taíno Indians were forced into an encomienda system of forced labor in the early years of colonization . The population suffered extremely high fatalities from epidemics of European infectious diseases . Colonization , the habsburgs In 1520 , King Charles I of Spain issued a royal decree collectively emancipating the remaining Taíno population . By that time , the Taíno people were few in number . Enslaved Africans had already begun to be imported to compensate for the native labor loss , but their numbers were proportionate to the diminished commercial interest Spain soon began to demonstrate for the island colony . Other nearby islands , like Cuba , Saint - Domingue , and Guadeloupe , attracted more of the slave trade than Puerto Rico , probably because of greater agricultural interests in those islands , on which colonists had developed large sugar plantations and had the capital to invest in the Atlantic slave trade . From the beginning of the country , the colonial administration relied heavily on the industry of enslaved Africans and creole blacks for public works and defenses , primarily in coastal ports and cities , where the tiny colonial population had hunkered down . With no significant industries or large - scale agricultural production as yet , enslaved and free communities lodged around the few littoral settlements , particularly around San Juan , also forming lasting Afro - creole communities . Meanwhile , in the island 's interior , there developed a mixed and independent peasantry that relied on a subsistence economy . This mostly unsupervised population supplied villages and settlements with foodstuffs and , in relative isolation , set the pattern for what later would be known as the Puerto Rican Jíbaro culture . By the end of the 16th century , the Spanish Empire was diminishing and , in the face of increasing raids from European competitors , the colonial administration throughout the Americas fell into a `` bunker mentality '' . Imperial strategists and urban planners redesigned port settlements into military posts with the objective of protecting Spanish territorial claims and ensuring the safe passing of the king 's silver - laden Atlantic Fleet to the Iberian Peninsula . San Juan served as an important port - of - call for ships driven across the Atlantic by its powerful trade winds . West Indies convoys linked Spain to the island , sailing between Cádiz and the Spanish West Indies . The colony 's seat of government was on the forested Islet of San Juan and for a time became one of the most heavily fortified settlements in the Spanish Caribbean earning the name of the `` Walled City '' . The islet is still dotted with the various forts and walls , such as La Fortaleza , Castillo San Felipe del Morro , and Castillo San Cristóbal , designed to protect the population and the strategic Port of San Juan from the raids of the Spanish European competitors . Hendricksz 1625 attack on San Juan , Puerto Rico In 1625 , in the Battle of San Juan , the Dutch commander Boudewijn Hendricksz tested the defenses ' limits like no one else before . Learning from Francis Drake 's previous failures here , he circumvented the cannons of the castle of San Felipe del Morro and quickly brought his 17 ships into the San Juan Bay . He then occupied the port and attacked the city while the population hurried for shelter behind the Morro 's moat and high battlements . Historians consider this event the worst attack on San Juan . Though the Dutch set the village on fire , they failed to conquer the Morro , and its batteries pounded their troops and ships until Hendricksz deemed the cause lost . Hendricksz 's expedition eventually helped propel a fortification frenzy . Constructions of defenses for the San Cristóbal Hill were soon ordered so as to prevent the landing of invaders out of reach of the Morro 's artillery . Urban planning responded to the needs of keeping the colony in Spanish hands . Late colonial period Hacienda La Fortuna . A sugar mill complex in Puerto Rico painted by Francisco Oller in 1885 ( Brooklyn Museum ) During the late 16th and early 17th centuries , Spain concentrated its colonial efforts on the more prosperous mainland North , Central , and South American colonies . With the advent of the lively Bourbon Dynasty in Spain in the 1700s , the island of Puerto Rico began a gradual shift to more imperial attention . More roads began connecting previously isolated inland settlements to coastal cities , and coastal settlements like Arecibo , Mayaguez , and Ponce began acquiring importance of their own , separate from San Juan . By the end of the 18th century , merchant ships from an array of nationalities threatened the tight regulations of the Mercantilist system , which turned each colony solely toward the European metropole and limited contact with other nations . U.S. ships came to surpass Spanish trade and with this also came the exploitation of the island 's natural resources . Slavers , which had made but few stops on the island before , began selling more enslaved Africans to growing sugar and coffee plantations . The increasing number of Atlantic wars in which the Caribbean islands played major roles , like the War of Jenkins ' Ear , the Seven Years ' War and the Atlantic Revolutions , ensured Puerto Rico 's growing esteem in Madrid 's eyes . On April 17 , 1797 , Sir Ralph Abercromby 's fleet invaded the island with a force of 6,000 -- 13,000 men , which included German soldiers and Royal Marines and 60 to 64 ships . Fierce fighting continued for the next days with Spanish troops . Both sides suffered heavy losses . On Sunday April 30 the British ceased their attack and began their retreat from San Juan . By the time independence movements in the larger Spanish colonies gained success , new waves of loyal creole immigrants began to arrive in Puerto Rico , helping to tilt the island 's political balance toward the Crown . The 16th - century fort , Castillo San Felipe del Morro , in San Juan , Puerto Rico In 1809 , to secure its political bond with the island and in the midst of the European Peninsular War , the Supreme Central Junta based in Cádiz recognized Puerto Rico as an overseas province of Spain . This gave the island residents the right to elect representatives to the recently convened Spanish parliament ( Cádiz Cortes ) , with equal representation to mainland Iberian , Mediterranean ( Balearic Islands ) and Atlantic maritime Spanish provinces ( Canary Islands ) . Ramón Power y Giralt , the first Spanish parliamentary representative from the island of Puerto Rico , died after serving a three - year term in the Cortes . These parliamentary and constitutional reforms were in force from 1810 to 1814 , and again from 1820 to 1823 . They were twice reversed during the restoration of the traditional monarchy by Ferdinand VII . Immigration and commercial trade reforms in the 19th century increased the island 's ethnic European population and economy and expanded the Spanish cultural and social imprint on the local character of the island . Minor slave revolts had occurred on the island throughout the years , with the revolt planned and organized by Marcos Xiorro in 1821 being the most important . Even though the conspiracy was unsuccessful , Xiorro achieved legendary status and is part of Puerto Rico 's folklore . Politics of liberalism The flag flown by Fidel Vélez and his men during the `` Intentona de Yauco '' revolt In the early 19th century , Puerto Rico spawned an independence movement that , due to harsh persecution by the Spanish authorities , convened in the island of St. Thomas . The movement was largely inspired by the ideals of Simón Bolívar in establishing a United Provinces of New Granada and Venezuela , that included Puerto Rico and Cuba . Among the influential members of this movement were Brigadier General Antonio Valero de Bernabé and María de las Mercedes Barbudo . The movement was discovered , and Governor Miguel de la Torre had its members imprisoned or exiled . With the increasingly rapid growth of independent former Spanish colonies in the South and Central American states in the first part of the 19th century , the Spanish Crown considered Puerto Rico and Cuba of strategic importance . To increase its hold on its last two New World colonies , the Spanish Crown revived the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815 as a result of which 450,000 immigrants , mainly Spaniards , settled on the island in the period up until the American conquest . Printed in three languages -- Spanish , English , and French -- it was intended to also attract non-Spanish Europeans , with the hope that the independence movements would lose their popularity if new settlers had stronger ties to the Crown . Hundreds of non Spanish families , mainly from Corsica , France , Germany , Ireland , Italy and Scotland , also immigrated to the island . Free land was offered as an incentive to those who wanted to populate the two islands , on the condition that they swear their loyalty to the Spanish Crown and allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church . The offer was very successful , and European immigration continued even after 1898 . Puerto Rico still receives Spanish and European immigration . The Lares Revolutionary Flag Poverty and political estrangement with Spain led to a small but significant uprising in 1868 known as Grito de Lares . It began in the rural town of Lares , but was subdued when rebels moved to the neighboring town of San Sebastián . Leaders of this independence movement included Ramón Emeterio Betances , considered the `` father '' of the Puerto Rican independence movement , and other political figures such as Segundo Ruiz Belvis . Slavery was abolished in Puerto Rico in 1873 , `` with provisions for periods of apprenticeship '' . Abolition Park in Ponce , Puerto Rico Leaders of `` El Grito de Lares '' went into exile in New York City . Many joined the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee , founded on December 8 , 1895 , and continued their quest for Puerto Rican independence . In 1897 , Antonio Mattei Lluberas and the local leaders of the independence movement in Yauco organized another uprising , which became known as the Intentona de Yauco . They raised what they called the Puerto Rican flag , which was adopted as the national flag . The local conservative political factions opposed independence . Rumors of the planned event spread to the local Spanish authorities who acted swiftly and put an end to what would be the last major uprising in the island to Spanish colonial rule . In 1897 , Luis Muñoz Rivera and others persuaded the liberal Spanish government to agree to grant limited self - government to the island by royal decree in the Autonomic Charter , including a bicameral legislature . In 1898 , Puerto Rico 's first , but short - lived , quasi-autonomous government was organized as an `` overseas province '' of Spain . This bilaterally agreed - upon charter maintained a governor appointed by the King of Spain -- who held the power to annul any legislative decision -- and a partially elected parliamentary structure . In February , Governor - General Manuel Macías inaugurated the new government under the Autonomic Charter . General elections were held in March and the new government began to function on July 17 , 1898 . American era ( 1898 -- present ) Main article : Puerto Rican Campaign In 1890 , Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan , a member of the Navy War Board and leading U.S. strategic thinker , published a book titled The Influence of Sea Power upon History in which he argued for the establishment of a large and powerful navy modeled after the British Royal Navy . Part of his strategy called for the acquisition of colonies in the Caribbean , which would serve as coaling and naval stations . They would serve as strategic points of defense with the construction of a canal through the Isthmus of Panama , to allow easier passage of ships between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans . The first company of Puerto Ricans enlisted in the U.S. Army , 1899 William H. Seward , the former Secretary of State under presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson , had also stressed the importance of building a canal in Honduras , Nicaragua or Panama . He suggested that the United States annex the Dominican Republic and purchase Puerto Rico and Cuba . The U.S. Senate did not approve his annexation proposal , and Spain rejected the U.S. offer of 160 million dollars for Puerto Rico and Cuba . Since 1894 , the United States Naval War College had been developing contingency plans for a war with Spain . By 1896 , the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence had prepared a plan that included military operations in Puerto Rican waters . Except for one 1895 plan , which recommended annexation of the island then named Isle of Pines ( later renamed as Isla de la Juventud ) , a recommendation dropped in later planning , plans developed for attacks on Spanish territories were intended as support operations against Spain 's forces in and around Cuba . Recent research suggests that the U.S. did consider Puerto Rico valuable as a naval station , and recognized that it and Cuba generated lucrative crops of sugar -- a valuable commercial commodity which the United States lacked , before the development of the Sugar Beet industry in the United States . Children in a company housing settlement , 1941 On July 25 , 1898 , during the Spanish -- American War , the U.S. invaded Puerto Rico with a landing at Guánica . As an outcome of the war , Spain ceded Puerto Rico , along with the Philippines and Guam , then under Spanish sovereignty , to the U.S. under the Treaty of Paris , which went into effect on April 11 , 1899 . Spain relinquished sovereignty over Cuba , but did not cede it to the U.S. United States unincorporated organized territory ( 1900 -- 1952 ) The United States and Puerto Rico began a long - standing metropolis - colony relationship . In the early 20th century , Puerto Rico was ruled by the military , with officials including the governor appointed by the President of the United States . The Foraker Act of 1900 gave Puerto Rico a certain amount of civilian popular government , including a popularly elected House of Representatives . The upper house and governor were appointed by the United States . The First Supreme Court of Puerto Rico , appointed pursuant to the Foraker Act Its judicial system was constructed to follow the American legal system ; a Puerto Rico Supreme Court and a United State District Court for the territory were established . It was authorized a non-voting member of Congress , by the title of `` Resident Commissioner '' , who was appointed . In addition , this Act extended all U.S. laws `` not locally inapplicable '' to Puerto Rico , specifying , in particular , exemption from U.S. Internal Revenue laws . The Act empowered the civil government to legislate on `` all matters of legislative character not locally inapplicable '' , including the power to modify and repeal any laws then in existence in Puerto Rico , though the U.S. Congress retained the power to annul acts of the Puerto Rico legislature . During an address to the Puerto Rican legislature in 1906 , President Theodore Roosevelt recommended that Puerto Ricans become U.S. citizens . In 1914 , the Puerto Rican House of Delegates voted unanimously in favor of independence from the United States , but this was rejected by the U.S. Congress as `` unconstitutional '' , and in violation of the 1900 Foraker Act . U.S. citizenship and Puerto Rican citizenship In 1917 , the U.S. Congress passed the Jones -- Shafroth Act , popularly called the Jones Act , which granted Puerto Ricans , born on or after , April 25 , 1898 , U.S. citizenship . Opponents , which included all of the Puerto Rican House of Delegates , who voted unanimously against it , said that the U.S. imposed citizenship in order to draft Puerto Rican men into the army as American entry into World War I became likely . The same Act provided for a popularly elected Senate to complete a bicameral Legislative Assembly , as well as a bill of rights . It authorized the popular election of the Resident Commissioner to a four - year term . Soldiers of the 65th Infantry training in Salinas , Puerto Rico ( August 1941 ) Natural disasters , including a major earthquake and tsunami in 1918 , and several hurricanes , and the Great Depression impoverished the island during the first few decades under U.S. rule . Some political leaders , such as Pedro Albizu Campos , who led the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party , demanded change in relations with the United States . He organized a protest at the University of Puerto Rico in 1935 , in which four were killed by police . In 1936 , U.S. Senator Millard Tydings introduced a bill supporting independence for Puerto Rico , but it was opposed by Luis Muñoz Marín of the Liberal Party of Puerto Rico . ( Tydings had co-sponsored the Tydings -- McDuffie Act , which provided independence to the Philippines after a 10 - year transition under a limited autonomy . ) All the Puerto Rican parties supported the bill , but Muñoz Marín opposed it . Tydings did not gain passage of the bill . In 1937 , Albizu Campos ' party organized a protest in which numerous people were killed by police in Ponce . The Insular Police , resembling the National Guard , opened fire upon unarmed cadets and bystanders alike . The attack on unarmed protesters was reported by the U.S. Congressman Vito Marcantonio and confirmed by the report of the Hays Commission , which investigated the events . The commission was led by Arthur Garfield Hays , counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union . Nineteen people were killed and over 200 were badly wounded , many in their backs while running away . The Hays Commission declared it a massacre and police mob action , and it has since been known as the Ponce massacre . In the aftermath , on April 2 , 1943 , Tydings introduced a bill in Congress calling for independence for Puerto Rico . This bill ultimately was defeated . During the latter years of the Roosevelt -- Truman administrations , the internal governance was changed in a compromise reached with Luis Muñoz Marín and other Puerto Rican leaders . In 1946 , President Truman appointed the first Puerto Rican - born governor , Jesús T. Piñero . Since 2007 , the Puerto Rico State Department has developed a protocol to issue certificates of Puerto Rican citizenship to Puerto Ricans . In order to be eligible , applicants must have been born in Puerto Rico ; born outside of Puerto Rico to a Puerto Rican -- born parent ; or be an American citizen with at least one year of residence in Puerto Rico . United States unincorporated organized territory with Commonwealth Constitution ( 1952 -- present ) In 1947 , the U.S. granted Puerto Ricans the right to democratically elect their own governor . In 1948 , Luis Muñoz Marín became the first popularly elected governor of Puerto Rico . Painting of bayonet charge by the U.S. 65th Infantry Regiment , made up of Puerto Rican troops , against a Chinese division during the Korean War A bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and nationalist movements in the island . The Senate at the time was controlled by the Popular Democratic Party ( PPD ) , and was presided over by Luis Muñoz Marín . The bill , also known as the Gag Law ( Spanish : Ley de la Mordaza ) , was approved by the legislature on May 21 , 1948 . It made it illegal to display a Puerto Rican flag , to sing a pro-independence tune , to talk of independence , or to campaign for independence . The bill , which resembled the Smith Act passed in the United States , was signed and made into law on June 10 , 1948 , by the U.S. appointed governor of Puerto Rico , Jesús T. Piñero , and became known as `` Law 53 '' ( Spanish : Ley 53 ) . In accordance with this law , it would be a crime to print , publish , sell , exhibit , organize or help anyone organize any society , group or assembly of people whose intentions are to paralyze or destroy the insular government . Anyone accused and found guilty of disobeying the law could be sentenced to ten years of prison , be fined $10,000 ( U.S. ) , or both . According to Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa , a member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives , the law was repressive and in violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution , which guarantees Freedom of Speech . He asserted that the law as such was a violation of the civil rights of the people of Puerto Rico . The law was repealed in 1957 . Estado Libre Asociado In 1950 , the U.S. Congress granted Puerto Ricans the right to organize a constitutional convention via a referendum that gave them the option of voting their preference , `` yes '' or `` no '' , on a proposed U.S. law that would organize Puerto Rico as a `` commonwealth '' that would continue United States sovereignty over Puerto Rico and its people . Puerto Rico 's electorate expressed its support for this measure in 1951 with a second referendum to ratify the constitution . The Constitution of Puerto Rico was formally adopted on July 3 , 1952 . The Constitutional Convention specified the name by which the body politic would be known . On February 4 , 1952 , the convention approved Resolution 22 which chose in English the word Commonwealth , meaning a `` politically organized community '' or `` state '' , which is simultaneously connected by a compact or treaty to another political system . Puerto Rico officially designates itself with the term `` Commonwealth of Puerto Rico '' in its constitution , as a translation into English of the term to `` Estado Libre Asociado '' ( ELA ) . In 1967 Puerto Rico 's Legislative Assembly polled the political preferences of the Puerto Rican electorate by passing a plebiscite act that provided for a vote on the status of Puerto Rico . This constituted the first plebiscite by the Legislature for a choice among three status options ( commonwealth , statehood , and independence ) . In subsequent plebiscites organized by Puerto Rico held in 1993 and 1998 ( without any formal commitment on the part of the U.S. Government to honor the results ) , the current political status failed to receive majority support . In 1993 , Commonwealth status won by a plurality of votes ( 48.6 % versus 46.3 % for statehood ) , while the `` none of the above '' option , which was the Popular Democratic Party - sponsored choice , won in 1998 with 50.3 % of the votes ( versus 46.5 % for statehood ) . Disputes arose as to the definition of each of the ballot alternatives , and Commonwealth advocates , among others , reportedly urged a vote for `` none of the above '' . In 1950 , the U.S. Congress approved Public Law 600 ( P.L. 81 - 600 ) , which allowed for a democratic referendum in Puerto Rico to determine whether Puerto Ricans desired to draft their own local constitution . This Act was meant to be adopted in the `` nature of a compact '' . It required congressional approval of the Puerto Rico Constitution before it could go into effect , and repealed certain sections of the Organic Act of 1917 . The sections of this statute left in force were entitled the Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act . U.S. Secretary of the Interior Oscar L. Chapman , under whose Department resided responsibility of Puerto Rican affairs , clarified the new commonwealth status in this manner : `` The bill ( to permit Puerto Rico to write its own constitution ) merely authorizes the people of Puerto Rico to adopt their own constitution and to organize a local government ... The bill under consideration would not change Puerto Rico 's political , social , and economic relationship to the United States . '' External video Puerto Rico , U.S. Embassy in Vienna , October 24 , 2014 View newsreel scenes in Spanish of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s on YouTube On October 30 , 1950 , Pedro Albizu Campos and other nationalists led a three - day revolt against the United States in various cities and towns of Puerto Rico , in what is known as the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s . The most notable occurred in Jayuya and Utuado . In the Jayuya revolt , known as the Jayuya Uprising , the Puerto Rican governor declared martial law , and attacked the insurgents in Jayuya with infantry , artillery and bombers under control of the Puerto Rican commander . The Utuado uprising culminated in what is known as the Utuado massacre . On November 1 , 1950 , Puerto Rican nationalists from New York City , Griselio Torresola and Oscar Collazo , attempted to assassinate President Harry S. Truman at his temporary residence of Blair House . Torresola was killed during the attack , but Collazo was wounded and captured . He was convicted of murder and sentenced to death , but President Truman commuted his sentence to life . After Collazo served 29 years in a federal prison , President Jimmy Carter commuted his sentence to times served and he was released in 1979 . Pedro Albizu Campos served many years in a federal prison in Atlanta , for seditious conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. government in Puerto Rico . The Constitution of Puerto Rico was approved by a Constitutional Convention on February 6 , 1952 , and 82 % of the voters in a March referendum . It was modified and ratified by the U.S. Congress , approved by President Truman on July 3 of that year , and proclaimed by Gov. Muñoz Marín on July 25 , 1952 . This was the anniversary of July 25 , 1898 , landing of U.S. troops in the Puerto Rican Campaign of the Spanish -- American War , until then celebrated as an annual Puerto Rico holiday . A shantytown along the Martin Peña Channel ( 1973 ) Puerto Rico adopted the name of Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico ( literally `` Associated Free State of Puerto Rico '' ) , officially translated into English as Commonwealth , for its body politic . `` The United States Congress legislates over many fundamental aspects of Puerto Rican life , including citizenship , the currency , the postal service , foreign policy , military defense , communications , labor relations , the environment , commerce , finance , health and welfare , and many others . '' During the 1950s and 1960s , Puerto Rico experienced rapid industrialization , due in large part to Operación Manos a la Obra ( `` Operation Bootstrap '' ) , an offshoot of FDR 's New Deal . It was intended to transform Puerto Rico 's economy from agriculture - based to manufacturing - based to provide more jobs . Puerto Rico has become a major tourist destination , as well as a global center for pharmaceutical manufacturing . Referendums on statehood or independence Four referendums have been held since the late 20th century to resolve the political status . The 2012 referendum showed a majority ( 54 % of the voters ) in favor of a change in status , with full statehood the preferred option of those who wanted a change . Because there were almost 500,000 blank ballots in the 2012 referendum , creating confusion as to the voters ' true desire , Congress decided to ignore the vote . The first three plebiscites provided voters with three options : statehood , free association , and independence . The Puerto Rican status referendum , 2017 in June 2017 was going to offer only two options : Statehood and Independence / Free Association . However , a letter from the Donald Trump administration recommended adding the Commonwealth , the current status , in the plebiscite . The option had been removed from this plebiscite in response to the results of the plebiscite in 2012 which asked whether to remain in the current status and No had won . The Trump administration cited changes in demographics during the past 5 years to add the option once again . Amendments to the plebiscite bill were adopted making ballot wording changes requested by the Department of Justice , as well as adding a `` current territorial status '' option . While 97 percent voted in favor of statehood , the turnout was low ; only some 23 percent voted . After the ballots were counted the Justice Department was non-committal . The Justice Department had asked for the 2017 plebiscite to be postponed but the Rosselló government chose not to do so . After the outcome was announced , the department told the Associated Press that it had `` not reviewed or approved the ballot 's language '' . Former Governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá ( 2005 -- 2009 ) is convinced that statehood is not the solution for either the U.S. or for Puerto Rico `` for economic , identity and cultural reasons '' . He pointed out that voter turnout for the 2017 referendum was extremely low , and suggests that a different type of mutually - beneficial relationship should be found . If the federal government agrees to discuss an association agreement , the conditions would be negotiated between the two entities . The agreement might cover topics such as the role of the U.S. military in Puerto Rico , the use of the U.S. currency , free trade between the two entities , and whether Puerto Ricans would be U.S. citizens . The three current Free Associated States ( Marshall Islands , Micronesia and Palau ) use the American dollar , receive some financial support and the promise of military defense if they refuse military access to any other country . Their citizens are allowed to work in the U.S. and serve in its military . Governor Ricardo Rosselló is strongly in favor of statehood to help develop the economy and help to `` solve our 500 - year - old colonial dilemma ... Colonialism is not an option ... It 's a civil rights issue ... 3.5 million citizens seeking an absolute democracy , '' he told the news media . Benefits of statehood include an additional $10 billion per year in federal funds , the right to vote in presidential elections , higher Social Security and Medicare benefits , and a right for its government agencies and municipalities to file for bankruptcy . The latter is currently prohibited . Statehood might be useful as a means of dealing with the financial crisis , since it would allow for bankruptcy and the relevant protection . According to the Government Development Bank , this might be the only solution to the debt crisis . Congress has the power to vote to allow Chapter 9 protection without the need for statehood , but in late 2015 there was very little support in the House for this concept . Other benefits to statehood include increased disability benefits and Medicaid funding , the right to vote in Presidential elections and the higher ( federal ) minimum wage . Subsequent to the 2017 referendum , Puerto Rico 's legislators are also expected to vote on a bill that would allow the Governor to draft a state constitution and hold elections to choose senators and representatives to the federal Congress . In spite of the outcome of the referendum , and the so - called Tennessee Plan ( above ) , action by the United States Congress would be necessary to implement changes to the status of Puerto Rico under the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution . United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization Since 1953 , the UN has been considering the political status of Puerto Rico and how to assist it in achieving `` independence '' or `` decolonization '' . In 1978 , the Special Committee determined that a `` colonial relationship '' existed between the U.S. and Puerto Rico . The UN 's Special Committee on Decolonization has often referred to Puerto Rico as a `` nation '' in its reports , because , internationally , the people of Puerto Rico are often considered to be a Caribbean nation with their own national identity . Most recently , in a June 2016 report , the Special Committee called for the United States to expedite the process to allow self - determination in Puerto Rico . More specifically , the group called on the United States to expedite a process that would allow the people of Puerto Rico to exercise fully their right to self - determination and independence ... allow the Puerto Rican people to take decisions in a sovereign manner , and to address their urgent economic and social needs , including unemployment , marginalization , insolvency and poverty `` . International status On November 27 , 1953 , shortly after the establishment of the Commonwealth , the General Assembly of the United Nations approved Resolution 748 , removing Puerto Rico 's classification as a non-self - governing territory . The General Assembly did not apply the full list of criteria which was enunciated in 1960 when it took favorable note of the cessation of transmission of information regarding the non-self - governing status of Puerto Rico . According to the White House Task Force on Puerto Rico 's Political Status in its December 21 , 2007 report , the U.S. , in its written submission to the UN in 1953 , never represented that Congress could not change its relationship with Puerto Rico without the territory 's consent . It stated that the U.S. Justice Department in 1959 reiterated that Congress held power over Puerto Rico pursuant to the Territorial Clause of the U.S. Constitution . In 1993 the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit stated that Congress may unilaterally repeal the Puerto Rican Constitution or the Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act and replace them with any rules or regulations of its choice . In a 1996 report on a Puerto Rico status political bill , the U.S. House Committee on Resources stated , `` Puerto Rico 's current status does not meet the criteria for any of the options for full self - government under Resolution 1541 '' ( the three established forms of full self - government being stated in the report as ( 1 ) national independence , ( 2 ) free association based on separate sovereignty , or ( 3 ) full integration with another nation on the basis of equality ) . The report concluded that Puerto Rico `` ... remains an unincorporated colony and does not have the status of ' free association ' with the United States as that status is defined under United States law or international practice '' , that the establishment of local self - government with the consent of the people can be unilaterally revoked by the U.S. Congress , and that U.S. Congress can also withdraw the U.S. citizenship of Puerto Rican residents of Puerto Rico at any time , for a legitimate Federal purpose . The application of the U.S. Constitution to Puerto Rico is limited by the Insular Cases . In 2006 , 2007 , 2009 , 2010 , and 2011 the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization passed resolutions calling on the United States to expedite a process `` that would allow Puerto Ricans to fully exercise their inalienable right to self - determination and independence '' , and to release all Puerto Rican political prisoners in U.S. prisons , to clean up , decontaminate and return the lands in the islands of Vieques and Culebra to the people of Puerto Rico , to perform a probe into U.S. human rights violations on the island and a probe into the killing by the FBI of pro-independence leader Filiberto Ojeda Rios . 21st century Further information : Proposed political status for Puerto Rico ; Puerto Rican status referendum , 2012 ; and President 's Task Force on Puerto Rico 's Status Puerto Rican status referendum , 2012 Location Puerto Rico Date November 6 , 2012 ; 5 years ago ( 2012 - 11 - 06 ) Voting system simple majority for the first question first - past - the - post for the second question Should Puerto Rico continue its current territorial status ? Yes 46.00 % No 54.00 % Which non-territorial option do you prefer ? Statehood 61.16 % Sovereign Free Associated State 33.34 % Independence 5.49 % There were 515,348 blank and invalidated ballots counted alongside the 1,363,854 ballots which indicated a choice for one of the non-territorial alternatives . Under Puerto Rico Law , these ballots are not considered cast votes and are therefore not reflected in the final tally . On July 15 , 2009 , the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization approved a draft resolution calling on the Government of the United States to expedite a process that would allow the Puerto Rican people to exercise fully their inalienable right to self - determination and independence . On April 29 , 2010 , the U.S. House voted 223 -- 169 to approve a measure for a federally sanctioned process for Puerto Rico 's self - determination , allowing Puerto Rico to set a new referendum on whether to continue its present form of commonwealth , or to have a different political status . If Puerto Ricans voted to continue as a commonwealth , the Government of Puerto Rico was authorized to conduct additional plebiscites at intervals of every eight years from the date on which the results of the prior plebiscite were certified ; if Puerto Ricans voted to have a different political status , a second referendum would determine whether Puerto Rico would become a U.S. state , an independent country , or a sovereign nation associated with the U.S. that would not be subject to the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution . During the House debate , a fourth option , to retain its present form of commonwealth ( sometimes referred to as `` the status quo '' ) political status , was added as an option in the second plebiscite . Immediately following U.S. House passage , H.R. 2499 was sent to the U.S. Senate , where it was given two formal readings and referred to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources . On December 22 , 2010 , the 111th United States Congress adjourned without any Senate vote on H.R. 2499 , killing the bill . The latest Task Force report was released on March 11 , 2011 . The report suggested a two - plebiscite process , including a `` first plebiscite that requires the people of Puerto Rico to choose whether they wish to be part of the United States ( either via Statehood or Commonwealth ) or wish to be independent ( via Independence or Free Association ) . If continuing to be part of the United States were chosen in the first plebiscite , a second vote would be taken between Statehood and Commonwealth . '' On June 14 , 2011 , President Barack Obama `` promised to support ' a clear decision ' by the people of Puerto Rico on statehood '' . That same month , the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization passed a resolution and adopted a consensus text introduced by Cuba 's delegate on June 20 , 2011 , calling on the United States to expedite a process `` that would allow Puerto Ricans to fully exercise their inalienable right to self - determination and independence '' . On November 6 , 2012 , a two - question referendum took place , simultaneous with the general elections . The first question asked voters whether they wanted to maintain the current status under the territorial clause of the U.S. Constitution . The second question posed three alternate status options if the first question was approved : statehood , independence or free association . For the first question , 54 percent voted against the current Commonwealth status . For the second question , 61.16 % voted for statehood , 33.34 % for a sovereign free associated state , and 5.49 % for independence . There were also 515,348 blank and invalidated ballots , which are not reflected in the final tally , as they are not considered cast votes under Puerto Rico law . On December 11 , 2012 , Puerto Rico 's Legislature passed a concurrent resolution to request to the President and the U.S. Congress action on November 6 , 2012 plebiscite results . But on April 10 , 2013 , with the issue still being widely debated , the White House announced that it will seek $2.5 million to hold another referendum , this next one being the first Puerto Rican status referendum to be financed by the U.S. Federal government . In December 2015 , the U.S. Government submitted a brief as Amicus Curiae to the U.S. Supreme Court related to the case Commonwealth of Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle . The U.S. Government official position is that the U.S. Constitution does not contemplate `` sovereign territories '' . That the Court has consistently recognized that `` there is no sovereignty in a Territory of the United States but that of the United States itself '' . and a U.S. territory has `` no independent sovereignty comparable to that of a state . That is because `` the Government of a territory owes its existence wholly to the United States '' . Congress 's plenary authority over federal territories includes the authority to permit self - government , whereby local officials administer a territory 's internal affairs . On June 9 , 2016 , in Commonwealth of Puerto Rico vs Sanchez Valle , a 6 -- 2 majority of the Supreme Court of the United States determined that Puerto Rico is a territory and lacks Sovereignty . On June 30 , 2016 , the President of the United States of America signed a new law approved by U.S. Congress , H.R. 5278 : PROMESA , establishing a Control Board over the Puerto Rico Government . This board will have a significant degree of federal control involved in its establishment and operations . In particular , the authority to establish the control board derives from the federal government 's constitutional power to `` make all needful rules and regulations '' regarding U.S. territories ; The President would appoint all seven voting members of the board ; and the board would have broad sovereign powers to effectively overrule decisions by Puerto Rico 's legislature , governor , and other public authorities . Political status The latest referendum on statehood , independence , or an associated republic was held on November 6 , 2012 . The people of Puerto Rico made history by requesting , for the first time ever , the conclusion of the island 's current territorial status . Almost 78 % of registered voters participated in a plebiscite held to resolve Puerto Rico 's status , and a slim but clear majority ( 54 % ) disagreed with Puerto Rico maintaining its present territorial status . Furthermore , among the possible alternatives , sixty - one percent ( 61 % ) of voters chose the statehood option , while one third of the ballots were submitted blank . On December 11 , 2012 , the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico enacted a concurrent resolution requesting the President and the Congress of the United States to respond to the referendum of the people of Puerto Rico , held on November 6 , 2012 , to end its current form of territorial status and to begin the process to admit Puerto Rico as a State . The initiative has not made Puerto Rico into a state . In May , 2017 , the Natural Resources Defense Council reported that Puerto Rico 's water system was the worst as measured by the Clean Water Act . 70 % of the population drank water that violated U.S. law . Post Hurricane recovery In late September 2017 , Hurricane Maria hit the island as a Category 4 storm causing severe damage to homes , other buildings and infrastructure . The recovery as of late November was slow but progress had been made . Electricity was restored to two - thirds of the island , although there was some doubt as to the number of residents getting reliable power . In January 2018 , it was reported that close to 40 percent of the island 's customers still did not have electricity . The vast majority had access to water but were still required to boil it . The number still living in shelters had dropped to 982 with thousands of others living with relatives . The official death toll at the time was 58 but some sources indicated that the actual number is much higher . A dam on the island was close to failure and officials were concerned about additional flooding from this source . Thousands had left Puerto Rico , with close to 200,000 having arrived in Florida alone . Those who were then living on the mainland experienced difficulty in getting health care benefits . A New York Times report on November 27 said it was understandable that Puerto Ricans wanted to leave the island . `` Basic essentials are hard to find and electricity and other utilities are unreliable or entirely inaccessible . Much of the population has been unable to return to jobs or to school and access to health care has been severely limited . '' The Center for Puerto Rican Studies at New York 's Hunter College estimated that some half million people , about 14 % of the population , may permanently leave by 2019 . The total damage on the island was estimated as up to $95 billion . By the end of November , FEMA had received over a million applications for aid and had approved about a quarter of those . The US government had agreed in October to provide funding to rebuild and up to $4.9 billion in loans to help the island 's government . FEMA had $464 million earmarked to help local governments rebuild public buildings and infrastructure . Bills for other funding were being considered in Washington but little progress had been made on those . A November 28 , 2017 report by the Sierra Club included this comment : `` It will take years to rebuild Puerto Rico , not just from the worst hurricane to make landfall since 1932 , but to sustainably overcome environmental injustices which made Maria 's devastation even more catastrophic '' . Geography Main articles : Geography of Puerto Rico and Geology of Puerto Rico A map of Puerto Rico Puerto Rico consists of the main island of Puerto Rico and various smaller islands , including Vieques , Culebra , Mona , Desecheo , and Caja de Muertos . Of these five , only Culebra and Vieques are inhabited year - round . Mona , which has played a key role in maritime history , is uninhabited most of the year except for employees of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources . There are many other even smaller islets , like Monito , which is near to Mona , Isla de Cabras and La Isleta de San Juan , both located on the San Juan Bay . The latter is the only inhabited islet with communities like Old San Juan and Puerta de Tierra , and connected to the main island by bridges . The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has an area of 13,790 square kilometers ( 5,320 sq mi ) , of which 8,870 km ( 3,420 sq mi ) is land and 4,921 km ( 1,900 sq mi ) is water . Puerto Rico is larger than two U.S. states , Delaware and Rhode Island . The maximum length of the main island from east to west is 180 km ( 110 mi ) , and the maximum width from north to south is 65 km ( 40 mi ) . Puerto Rico is the smallest of the Greater Antilles . It is 80 % of the size of Jamaica , just over 18 % of the size of Hispaniola and 8 % of the size of Cuba , the largest of the Greater Antilles . The island is mostly mountainous with large coastal areas in the north and south . The main mountain range is called `` La Cordillera Central '' ( The Central Range ) . The highest elevation in Puerto Rico , Cerro de Punta 1,338 meters ( 4,390 ft ) , is located in this range . Another important peak is El Yunque , one of the highest in the Sierra de Luquillo at the El Yunque National Forest , with an elevation of 1,065 m ( 3,494 ft ) . The coast at Patillas , Puerto Rico Puerto Rico has 17 lakes , all man - made , and more than 50 rivers , most originating in the Cordillera Central . Rivers in the northern region of the island are typically longer and of higher water flow rates than those of the south , since the south receives less rain than the central and northern regions . Puerto Rico is composed of Cretaceous to Eocene volcanic and plutonic rocks , overlain by younger Oligocene and more recent carbonates and other sedimentary rocks . Most of the caverns and karst topography on the island occurs in the northern region in the carbonates . The oldest rocks are approximately 190 million years old ( Jurassic ) and are located at Sierra Bermeja in the southwest part of the island . They may represent part of the oceanic crust and are believed to come from the Pacific Ocean realm . Puerto Rico lies at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American plates and is being deformed by the tectonic stresses caused by their interaction . These stresses may cause earthquakes and tsunamis . These seismic events , along with landslides , represent some of the most dangerous geologic hazards in the island and in the northeastern Caribbean . The most recent major earthquake occurred on October 11 , 1918 , and had an estimated magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale . It originated off the coast of Aguadilla , several kilometers off the northern coast , and was accompanied by a tsunami . It caused extensive property damage and widespread losses , damaging infrastructure , especially bridges . It resulted in an estimated 116 deaths and $4 million in property damage . The failure of the government to move rapidly to provide for the general welfare contributed to political activism by opponents and eventually to the rise of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party . The Puerto Rico Trench , the largest and deepest trench in the Atlantic , is located about 115 km ( 71 mi ) north of Puerto Rico at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American plates . It is 280 km ( 170 mi ) long . At its deepest point , named the Milwaukee Deep , it is almost 8,400 m ( 27,600 ft ) deep . Climate Puerto Rico seen from space ( STS - 34 mission ) Main article : Climate of Puerto Rico The climate of Puerto Rico in the Köppen climate classification is tropical rainforest . Temperatures are warm to hot year round , averaging near 85 ° F ( 29 ° C ) in lower elevations and 70 ° F ( 21 ° C ) in the mountains . Easterly trade winds pass across the island year round . Puerto Rico has a rainy season which stretches from April into November . The mountains of the Cordillera Central are the main cause of the variations in the temperature and rainfall that occur over very short distances . The mountains can also cause wide variation in local wind speed and direction due to their sheltering and channeling effects adding to the climatic variation . The island has an average temperature of 82.4 ° F ( 28 ° C ) throughout the year , with an average minimum temperature of 66.9 ° F ( 19 ° C ) and maximum of 85.4 ° F ( 30 ° C ) . Daily temperature changes seasonally are quite small in the lowlands and coastal areas . The temperature in the south is usually a few degrees higher than the north and temperatures in the central interior mountains are always cooler than those on the rest of the island . Between the dry and wet season , there is a temperature change of around 6 ° F ( 3.3 ° C ) . This is mainly due to the warm waters of the tropical Atlantic Ocean , which significantly modify cooler air moving in from the north and northwest . Coastal waters temperatures around the years are about 75 ° F ( 24 ° C ) in February to 85 ° F ( 29 ° C ) in August . The highest temperature ever recorded was 99 ° F ( 37 ° C ) at Arecibo , while the lowest temperature ever recorded was 40 ° F ( 4 ° C ) in the mountains at Adjuntas , Aibonito , and Corozal . The average yearly precipitation is 1,687 mm ( 66 in ) .

The Weather Channel . Retrieved March 22 , 2014 . Puerto Rico experiences the Atlantic hurricane season , similar to the remainder of the Caribbean Sea and North Atlantic oceans . On average , a quarter of its annual rainfall is contributed from tropical cyclones , which are more prevalent during periods of La Niña than El Niño . A cyclone of tropical storm strength passes near Puerto Rico , on average , every five years . A hurricane passes in the vicinity of the island , on average , every seven years . Since 1851 , the Lake Okeechobee Hurricane of September 1928 is the only hurricane to make landfall as a Category 5 hurricane . In the busy 2017 Atlantic hurricane season , Puerto Rico avoided a direct hit by the Category 5 Hurricane Irma on September 8 , 2017 , but high winds caused a loss of electrical power to some one million residents . Almost 50 % of hospitals were operating with power provided by generators . The Category 4 Hurricane Jose , as expected , veered away from Puerto Rico . A short time later , the devastating Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane , with sustained 155 mph ( 249 km / h ) winds , powerful rains and widespread flooding causing tremendous destruction , including the electrical grid , which could remain out for 4 -- 6 months . With such widespread destruction and a great need for supplies -- everything from drinking water , food , medicine and personal care items to fuel for generators and construction materials for rebuilding the island -- Gov. Rossello and several Congressmen called on the federal government to waive the WWI - era Jones Act ( protectionist provisions : ships made and owned in U.S. , and with U.S. crews ) , which essentially double Puerto Rico 's cost for shipped goods relative to neighboring islands . On September 28 , U.S. President Donald Trump waived the Act for ten days . Biodiversity Main articles : Fauna of Puerto Rico and Flora of Puerto Rico Common Coquí Species endemic to the archipelago number 239 plants , 16 birds and 39 amphibians / reptiles , recognized as of 1998 . Most of these ( 234 , 12 and 33 respectively ) are found on the main island . The most recognizable endemic species and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride is the coquí , a small frog easily identified by the sound of its call , from which it gets its name . Most coquí species ( 13 of 17 ) live in the El Yunque National Forest , a tropical rainforest in the northeast of the island previously known as the Caribbean National Forest . El Yunque is home to more than 240 plants , 26 of which are endemic to the island . It is also home to 50 bird species , including the critically endangered Puerto Rican amazon . Across the island in the southwest , the 40 km ( 15 sq mi ) of dry land at the Guánica Commonwealth Forest Reserve contain over 600 uncommon species of plants and animals , including 48 endangered species and 16 endemic to Puerto Rico .

From 2000 to 2010 , the population decreased , the first such decrease in census history for Puerto Rico . It went from the 3,808,610 residents registered in the 2000 Census to 3,725,789 in the 2010 Census . A declining and aging population presents additional problems for the society . The U.S. Census Bureau 's estimate for July 1 , 2016 was 3,411,307 people , down substantially from the 2010 data which had indicated 3,725,789 people . Continuous European immigration and high natural increase helped the population of Puerto Rico grow from 155,426 in 1800 , to almost a million by the close of the 19th century . A census conducted by royal decree on September 30 , 1858 , gave the following totals of the Puerto Rican population at that time : 341,015 were Free colored ; 300,430 identified as Whites ; and 41,736 were slaves . During the 19th century hundreds of families arrived in Puerto Rico , primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia , but also from other parts of Spain such as Catalonia , Asturias , Galicia and the Balearic Islands and numerous Spanish loyalists from Spain 's former colonies in South America . Settlers from outside Spain also arrived in the islands , including from Corsica , France , Lebanon , China , Portugal , Ireland , Scotland , Germany and Italy . This immigration from non-Hispanic countries was the result of the Real Cedula de Gracias de 1815 ( `` Royal Decree of Graces of 1815 '' ) , which allowed European Catholics to settle in the island with land allotments in the interior of the island , provided they paid taxes and continued to support the Catholic Church . Racial and Ethnic Composition in Puerto Rico ( 2015 Census est . ) Ethnicity White 75.8 % Black or African American 12.4 % Asian 0.2 % Two or more races 3.3 % American Indian 0.5 % Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander 0.1 % Other races 7.8 % Between 1960 and 1990 the census questionnaire in Puerto Rico did not ask about race or ethnicity . The 2000 United States Census included a racial self - identification question in Puerto Rico . According to the census , most Puerto Ricans identified as White and Hispanic ; few identified as Black or some other race . Population genetics A recent population genetics study conducted in Puerto Rico suggests that between 52.6 % and 84 % of the population possess some degree of Amerindian mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) in their maternal ancestry , usually in a combination with other ancestries such as aboriginal Guanche North - West African ancestry brought by Spanish settlers from the Canary Islands . In addition , these DNA studies show Amerindian ancestry in addition to the Taíno . One genetic study on the racial makeup of Puerto Ricans ( including all races ) found them to be roughly around 61 % West Eurasian / North African ( overwhelmingly of Spanish provenance ) , 27 % Sub-Saharan African and 11 % Native American . Another genetic study from 2007 , claimed that `` the average genomewide individual ( ie . Puerto Rican ) ancestry proportions have been estimated as 66 % , 18 % , and 16 % , for European , West African , and Native American , respectively . '' Other study estimates 63.7 % European , 21.2 % ( Sub-Saharan ) African , and 15.2 % Native American ; European ancestry is more prevalent in the West and in Central Puerto Rico , African in Eastern Puerto Rico , and Native American in Northern Puerto Rico . A Pew Research survey indicated a literacy rate of 90.4 % ( adult population ) in 2012 based on data from the United Nations and a life expectancy of 79.3 years . Immigration and emigration Racial groups Year Population White Mixed ( mainly biracial white European and black African ) Black Asian Other 2000 3,808,610 80.5 % ( 3 064 862 ) 11.0 % ( 418 426 ) 8.0 % ( 302 933 ) 0.2 % ( 7 960 ) 0.4 % ( 14 429 ) 3,725,789 75.8 % ( ' 2 824 148 ) 11.1 % ( ' 413 563 ) 12.4 % ( ' 461 998 ) 0.2 % ( ' 7 452 ) 0.6 % ( ' 22 355 ) Puerto Rico has recently become the permanent home of over 100,000 legal residents . The vast majority of recent immigrants , both legal and illegal , come from the Dominican Republic and Haiti . Other sources sending in significant numbers of recent immigrants include Cuba , Mexico , Colombia , Panama , Jamaica , Venezuela , Spain , and Nigeria . Also , there are many non-Puerto Rican U.S. citizens settling in Puerto Rico , from the mainland United States and the U.S. Virgin Islands , as well as Nuyoricans ( stateside Puerto Ricans ) coming back to Puerto Rico . Most recent immigrants settle in and around San Juan . Emigration is a major part of contemporary Puerto Rican history . Starting soon after World War II , poverty , cheap airfares , and promotion by the island government caused waves of Puerto Ricans to move to the United States , particularly to the Northeastern states , and Florida . This trend continued even as Puerto Rico 's economy improved and its birth rate declined . Puerto Ricans continue to follow a pattern of `` circular migration '' , with some migrants returning to the island . In recent years , the population has declined markedly , falling nearly 1 % in 2012 and an additional 1 % ( 36,000 people ) in 2013 due to a falling birthrate and emigration . According to the 2010 Census , the number of Puerto Ricans living in the United States outside of Puerto Rico far exceeds those living in Puerto Rico . Emigration exceeds immigration . As those who leave tend to be better educated than those that remain , this accentuates the drain on Puerto Rico 's economy . Based on the July 1 , 2016 estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau , the population of the Commonwealth had declined by 314,482 people since the 2010 Census data had been tabulated . Population distribution The most populous city is the capital , San Juan , with approximately 371,400 people based on a 2015 estimate by the Census Bureau . Other major cities include Bayamón , Carolina , Ponce , and Caguas . Of the ten most populous cities on the island , eight are located within what is considered San Juan 's metropolitan area , while the other two are located in the south ( Ponce ) and west ( Mayagüez ) of the island .

Spanish is , and has been , the only official language of the entire Commonwealth judiciary system , despite a 1902 English - only language law . However , all official business of the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico is conducted in English . English is the primary language of less than 10 % of the population . Spanish is the dominant language of business , education and daily life on the island , spoken by nearly 95 % of the population . The U.S. Census Bureau 's 2015 update provides the following facts : 94.1 % of adults speak Spanish , 5.8 % speak only English , 78.3 % do not speak English `` very well '' . In Puerto Rico , public school instruction is conducted almost entirely in Spanish . There have been pilot programs in about a dozen of the over 1,400 public schools aimed at conducting instruction in English only . Objections from teaching staff are common , perhaps because many of them are not fully fluent in English . English is taught as a second language and is a compulsory subject from elementary levels to high school . The languages of the deaf community are American Sign Language and its local variant , Puerto Rican Sign Language . The Spanish of Puerto Rico has evolved into having many idiosyncrasies in vocabulary and syntax that differentiate it from the Spanish spoken elsewhere . As a product of Puerto Rican history , the island possesses a unique Spanish dialect . Puerto Rican Spanish utilizes many Taíno words , as well as English words . The largest influence on the Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico is that of the Canary Islands . The Spanish of Puerto Rico also includes Taíno words , typically in the context of vegetation , natural phenomena or primitive musical instruments . Similarly , words attributed to primarily West African languages were adopted in the contexts of foods , music or dances , particularly in coastal towns with concentrations of descendants of Sub-Saharan Africans . Religion Religious Affiliation ( 2014 ) Roman Catholic ( 56 % ) Protestant ( 33 % ) Other ( 3 % ) Irreligious ( 8 % ) The Roman Catholic Church was brought by Spanish colonists and gradually became the dominant religion in Puerto Rico . The first dioceses in the Americas , including that of Puerto Rico , were authorized by Pope Julius II in 1511 . One Pope , John Paul II , visited Puerto Rico in October 1984 . All municipalities in Puerto Rico have at least one Catholic Church , most of which are located at the town center or `` plaza '' . African slaves brought and maintained various ethnic African religious practices associated with different peoples ; in particular , the Yoruba beliefs of Santería and / or Ifá , and the Kongo - derived Palo Mayombe . Some aspects were absorbed into syncretic Christianity . Protestantism , which was suppressed under the Spanish Catholic regime , has slightly reemerged under United States rule , making contemporary Puerto Rico more interconfessional than in previous centuries , although Catholicism continues to be the dominant religion . The first Protestant church , Iglesia de la Santísima Trinidad , was established in Ponce by the Anglican Diocese of Antigua in 1872 . It was the first non-Roman Catholic Church in the entire Spanish Empire in the Americas . Pollster Pablo Ramos stated in 1998 that the population was 38 % Roman Catholic , 28 % Pentecostal , and 18 % were members of independent churches , which would give a Protestant percentage of 46 % if the last two populations are combined . Protestants collectively added up to almost two million people . Another researcher gave a more conservative assessment of the proportion of Protestants : Puerto Rico , by virtue of its long political association with the United States , is the most Protestant of Latin American countries , with a Protestant population of approximately 33 to 38 percent , the majority of whom are Pentecostal . David Stoll calculates that if we extrapolate the growth rates of evangelical churches from 1960 -- 1985 for another twenty - five years Puerto Rico will become 75 percent evangelical . ( Ana Adams : `` Brincando el Charco ... '' in Power , Politics and Pentecostals in Latin America , Edward Cleary , ed. , 1997 . p. 164 ) . The data provided for 2014 by Pew Research Center , is summarized in the chart to the right . An Associated Press article in March 2014 stated that `` more than 70 percent of whom identify themselves as Catholic '' but provided no source for this information . The CIA World Factbook reports that 85 % of the population of Puerto Rico identifies as Roman Catholic , while 15 % identify as Protestant and Other . Neither a date or a source for that information is provided and may not be recent . A 2013 Pew Research survey found that only about 45 % of Puerto Rican adults identified themselves as Catholic , 29 % as Protestant and 20 % as unaffiliated with a religion . The people surveyed by Pew consisted of Puerto Ricans living in the 50 states and DC and may not be indicative of those living in the Commonwealth . By 2014 , a Pew Research report , with the sub-title Widespread Change in a Historically Catholic Region , indicated that only 56 % of Puerto Ricans were Catholic and that 33 % were Protestant ; this survey was completed between October 2013 and February 2014 . An Eastern Orthodox community , the Dormition of the Most Holy Theotokos / St. Spyridon 's Church is located in Trujillo Alto , and serves the small Orthodox community . This affiliation accounted for under 1 % of the population in 2010 according to the Pew Research report . In 1940 , Juanita García Peraza founded the Mita Congregation , the first religion of Puerto Rican origin . Taíno religious practices have been rediscovered / reinvented to a degree by a handful of advocates . Similarly , some aspects of African religious traditions have been kept by some adherents . In 1952 , a handful of American Jews established the island 's first synagogue ; this religion accounts for under 1 % of the population in 2010 according to the Pew Research report . The synagogue , called Sha'are Zedeck , hired its first rabbi in 1954 . Puerto Rico has the largest Jewish community in the Caribbean , numbering 3000 people ( date not stated ) , and is the only Caribbean island in which the Conservative , Reform and Orthodox Jewish movements all are represented . In 2007 , there were about 5,000 Muslims in Puerto Rico , representing about 0.13 % of the population . Eight mosques are located throughout the island , with most Muslims living in Río Piedras and Caguas , most of these Muslims are of Palestinian and Jordanian descent . In 2015 , the 25,832 Jehovah 's Witnesses represented about 0.70 % of the population , with 324 congregations . The Padmasambhava Buddhist Center , whose followers practice Tibetan Buddhism , has a branch in Puerto Rico . Roman Catholic Cathedral of San Juan Bautista . Anglican Iglesia Santísima Trinidad in Ponce Islamic Center at Ponce Inside Sha'are Zedeck in San Juan Government Main articles : Government of Puerto Rico and Politics of Puerto Rico Puerto Rico has 8 senatorial districts , 40 representative districts and 78 municipalities . It has a republican form of government with separation of powers subject to the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United States . Its current powers are all delegated by the United States Congress and lack full protection under the United States Constitution . Puerto Rico 's head of state is the President of the United States . The government of Puerto Rico , based on the formal republican system , is composed of three branches : the executive , legislative , and judicial branch . The executive branch is headed by the governor , currently Ricky Rosselló . The legislative branch consists of a bicameral legislature called the Legislative Assembly , made up of a Senate as its upper chamber and a House of Representatives as its lower chamber . The Senate is headed by the President of the Senate , currently Thomas Rivera Schatz , while the House of Representatives is headed by the Speaker of the House , currently Johnny Méndez . The governor and legislators are elected by popular vote every four years with the last election held in November 2016 . The judicial branch is headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico , currently Maite Oronoz Rodríguez . Members of the judicial branch are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate . Puerto Rico is represented in the United States Congress by a nonvoting delegate , the Resident Commissioner , currently Jenniffer González . Current congressional rules have removed the Commissioner 's power to vote in the Committee of the Whole , but the Commissioner can vote in committee . Puerto Rican elections are governed by the Federal Election Commission and the State Elections Commission of Puerto Rico . While residing in Puerto Rico , Puerto Ricans can not vote in U.S. presidential elections , but they can vote in primaries . Puerto Ricans who become residents of a U.S. state can vote in presidential elections . Puerto Rico hosts consulates from 41 countries , mainly from the Americas and Europe , with most located in San Juan . As an unincorporated territory of the United States , Puerto Rico does not have any first - order administrative divisions as defined by the U.S. government , but has 78 municipalities at the second level . Mona Island is not a municipality , but part of the municipality of Mayagüez . Municipalities are subdivided into wards or barrios , and those into sectors . Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected for a four - year term . The municipality of San Juan ( previously called `` town '' ) , was founded first , in 1521 , San Germán in 1570 , Coamo in 1579 , Arecibo in 1614 , Aguada in 1692 and Ponce in 1692 . An increase of settlement saw the founding of 30 municipalities in the 18th century and 34 in the 19th . Six were founded in the 20th century ; the last was Florida in 1971 . Political parties and elections Main article : Political party strength in Puerto Rico The difference between the incumbent party , the PPD , and its opponent , the PNP , was a mere 0.6 % in the last election . This difference is common as the political landscape experiences political cycles between both parties , with the PPD ruling all branches of government for 36 of the past 64 years . The PNP , on the other hand , has ruled both the executive and legislative branch concurrently for 16 years . The other 12 years experienced a divided government . Since 1952 , Puerto Rico has had three main political parties : the Popular Democratic Party ( PPD in Spanish ) , the New Progressive Party ( PNP in Spanish ) and the Puerto Rican Independence Party ( PIP ) . The three parties stand for different political status . The PPD , for example , seeks to maintain the island 's status with the U.S. as a commonwealth , while the PNP , on the other hand , seeks to make Puerto Rico a state of the United States . The PIP , in contrast , seeks a complete separation from the United States by seeking to make Puerto Rico a sovereign nation . In terms of party strength , the PPD and PNP usually hold about 47 % of the vote each while the PIP holds only about 5 % . After 2007 , other parties emerged on the island . The first , the Puerto Ricans for Puerto Rico Party ( PPR in Spanish ) was registered that same year . The party claims that it seeks to address the islands ' problems from a status - neutral platform . But it ceased to remain as a registered party when it failed to obtain the required number of votes in the 2008 general election . Four years later , the 2012 election saw the emergence of the Movimiento Unión Soberanista ( MUS ; English : Sovereign Union Movement ) and the Partido del Pueblo Trabajador ( PPT ; English : Working People 's Party ) but none obtained more than 1 % of the vote . Other non-registered parties include the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party , the Socialist Workers Movement , and the Hostosian National Independence Movement . Law Main articles : Constitution of Puerto Rico and Law of Puerto Rico The insular legal system is a blend of civil law and the common law systems . Puerto Rico is the only current U.S. possession whose legal system operates primarily in a language other than American English : namely , Spanish . Because the U.S. federal government operates primarily in English , all Puerto Rican attorneys must be bilingual in order to litigate in English in U.S. federal courts , and litigate federal preemption issues in Puerto Rican courts . Title 48 of the United States Code outlines the role of the United States Code to United States territories and insular areas such as Puerto Rico . After the U.S. government assumed control of Puerto Rico in 1901 , it initiated legal reforms resulting in the adoption of codes of criminal law , criminal procedure , and civil procedure modeled after those then in effect in California . Although Puerto Rico has since followed the federal example of transferring criminal and civil procedure from statutory law to rules promulgated by the judiciary , several portions of its criminal law still reflect the influence of the California Penal Code . The judicial branch is headed by the Chief Justice of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court , which is the only appellate court required by the Constitution . All other courts are created by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico . There is also a Federal District Court for Puerto Rico . Someone accused of a criminal act at the federal level may not be accused for the same act in a Commonwealth court , unlike a state court , since Puerto Rico as a territory lacks sovereignty separate from Congress as a state does . Such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy . Political status Main articles : Political status of Puerto Rico and Proposed political status for Puerto Rico The nature of Puerto Rico 's political relationship with the U.S. is the subject of ongoing debate in Puerto Rico , the United States Congress , and the United Nations . Specifically , the basic question is whether Puerto Rico should remain a U.S. territory , become a U.S. state , or become an independent country . Within the United States The Capitol of Puerto Rico , home of the Legislative Assembly in Puerto Rico Constitutionally , Puerto Rico is subject to the plenary powers of the United States Congress under the territorial clause of Article IV of the U.S. Constitution . Laws enacted at the federal level in the United States apply to Puerto Rico as well , regardless of its political status . Their residents do not have voting representation in the U.S. Congress . Like the different states of the United States , Puerto Rico lacks `` the full sovereignty of an independent nation '' , for example , the power to manage its `` external relations with other nations '' , which is held by the U.S. federal government . The Supreme Court of the United States has indicated that once the U.S. Constitution has been extended to an area ( by Congress or the courts ) , its coverage is irrevocable . To hold that the political branches may switch the Constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they , not this Court , say `` what the law is '' . Puerto Ricans `` were collectively made U.S. citizens '' in 1917 as a result of the Jones - Shafroth Act . U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico can not vote for the U.S. president , though both major parties , Republican and Democratic , run primary elections in Puerto Rico to send delegates to vote on a presidential candidate . Since Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory ( see above ) and not a U.S. state , the United States Constitution does not fully enfranchise U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico . Only fundamental rights under the American federal constitution and adjudications are applied to Puerto Ricans . Various other U.S. Supreme Court decisions have held which rights apply in Puerto Rico and which ones do not . Puerto Ricans have a long history of service in the U.S. Armed Forces and , since 1917 , they have been included in the U.S. compulsory draft whensoever it has been in effect . Though the Commonwealth government has its own tax laws , Puerto Ricans are also required to pay many kinds of U.S. federal taxes , not including the federal personal income tax for Puerto Rico - sourced income , but only under certain circumstances . In 2009 , Puerto Rico paid $3.742 billion into the U.S. Treasury . Residents of Puerto Rico pay into Social Security , and are thus eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement . They are excluded from the Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) , and the island actually receives a smaller fraction of the Medicaid funding it would receive if it were a U.S. state . Also , Medicare providers receive less - than - full state - like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in Puerto Rico , even though the latter paid fully into the system . While a state may try an individual for the same crime he / she was tried in federal court , this is not the case in Puerto Rico . Being a U.S. territory , Puerto Rico 's authority to enact a criminal code derives from Congress and not from local sovereignty as with the states . Thus , such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy and is constitutionally impermissible . In 1992 , President George H.W. Bush issued a memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies establishing the current administrative relationship between the federal government and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico . This memorandum directs all federal departments , agencies , and officials to treat Puerto Rico administratively as if it were a state , insofar as doing so would not disrupt federal programs or operations . Many federal executive branch agencies have significant presence in Puerto Rico , just as in any state , including the Federal Bureau of Investigation , Federal Emergency Management Agency , Transportation Security Administration , Social Security Administration , and others . While Puerto Rico has its own Commonwealth judicial system similar to that of a U.S. state , there is also a U.S. federal district court in Puerto Rico , and Puerto Ricans have served as judges in that Court and in other federal courts on the U.S. mainland regardless of their residency status at the time of their appointment . Sonia Sotomayor , a New Yorker of Puerto Rican descent , serves as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States . Puerto Ricans have also been frequently appointed to high - level federal positions , including serving as United States Ambassadors to other nations . Foreign and intergovernmental relations This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( November 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Main article : Foreign and intergovernmental relations of Puerto Rico Puerto Rico is subject to the Commerce and Territorial Clause of the Constitution of the United States and , therefore , is restricted on how it can engage with other nations , sharing the opportunities and limitations that state governments have albeit not being one . As is the case with state governments , regardless , it has established several trade agreements with other nations , particularly with Hispanic American countries such as Colombia and Panamá . It has also established trade promotion offices in many foreign countries , all Spanish - speaking , and within the United States itself , which now include Spain , the Dominican Republic , Panama , Colombia , Washington , D.C. , New York City and Florida , and has included in the past offices in Chile , Costa Rica , and Mexico . Such agreements require permission from the U.S. Department of State ; most , are simply allowed by existing laws or trade treaties between the United States and other nations which supersede trade agreements pursued by Puerto Rico and different U.S. states . At the local level , Puerto Rico established by law that the international relations which states and territories are allowed to engage must be handled by the Department of State of Puerto Rico , an executive department , headed by the Secretary of State of Puerto Rico , who also serves as the territory 's lieutenant governor . It is also charged to liaise with general consuls and honorary consuls based in Puerto Rico . The Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration , along with the Office of the Resident Commissioner , manage all its intergovernmental affairs before entities of or in the United States ( including the federal government of the United States , local and state governments of the United States , and public or private entities in the United States ) . Both entities frequently assist the Department of State of Puerto Rico in engaging with Washington , D.C. - based ambassadors and federal agencies that handle Puerto Rico 's foreign affairs , such as the U.S. Department of State , the Agency for International Development , and others . The current Secretary of State is Víctor Suárez Meléndez from the Popular Democratic Party and member of the Democratic Party of the United States , while the current Director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration is Juan Eugenio Hernández Mayoral also from the Popular Democratic and member of the Democratic Party . The Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico , the delegate elected by Puerto Ricans to represent them before the federal government , including the U.S. Congress , sits in the United States House of Representatives , serves and votes on congressional committees , and functions in every respect as a legislator except being denied a vote on the final disposition of legislation on the House floor , also engages in foreign affairs to the same extent as other members of Congress . The current Resident Commissioner is Pedro Pierluisi from the New Progressive Party and member of the Democratic Party of the United States . Many Puerto Ricans have served as United States ambassadors to different nations and international organizations , such as the Organization of American States , mostly but not exclusively in Latin America . For example , Maricarmen Aponte , a Puerto Rican and now an Acting Assistant Secretary of State , previously served as U.S. ambassador to El Salvador . Military Main article : Military of Puerto Rico As it is a territory of the United States of America , the defense of Puerto Rico is provided by the United States as part of the Treaty of Paris with the President of the United States as its commander - in - chief . Puerto Rico has its own Puerto Rico National Guard , and its own state defense force , the Puerto Rico State Guard , which by local law is under the authority of the Puerto Rico National Guard . The commander - in - chief of both local forces is the governor of Puerto Rico who delegates his authority to the Puerto Rico Adjutant General , currently Brigadier General Isabelo Rivera . The Adjutant General , in turn , delegates the authority over the State Guard to another officer but retains the authority over the Puerto Rico National Guard as a whole . U.S. military installations in Puerto Rico ( including the United States Virgin Islands ) throughout the 20th century U.S. military installations in Puerto Rico were part of the U.S. Atlantic Command ( LANTCOM after 1993 USACOM ) , which had authority over all U.S. military operations that took place throughout the Atlantic . Puerto Rico had been seen as crucial in supporting LANTCOM 's mission until 1999 , when U.S. Atlantic Command was renamed and given a new mission as United States Joint Forces Command . Puerto Rico is currently under the responsibility of United States Northern Command . Both the Naval Forces Caribbean ( NFC ) and the Fleet Air Caribbean ( FAIR ) were formerly based at the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station . The NFC had authority over all U.S. Naval activity in the waters of the Caribbean while FAIR had authority over all U.S. military flights and air operations over the Caribbean . With the closing of the Roosevelt Roads and Vieques Island training facilities , the U.S. Navy has basically exited from Puerto Rico , except for the ships that steam by , and the only significant military presence in the island is the U.S. Army at Ft Buchanan , the Puerto Rican Army and Air National Guards , and the U.S. Coast Guard . Protests over the noise of bombing practice forced the closure of the naval base . This resulted in a loss of 6,000 jobs and an annual decrease in local income of $300 million . A branch of the U.S. Army National Guard is stationed in Puerto Rico -- known as the Puerto Rico Army National Guard -- which performs missions equivalent to those of the Army National Guards of the different states of the United States , including ground defense , disaster relief , and control of civil unrest . The local National Guard also incorporates a branch of the U.S. Air National Guard -- known as the Puerto Rico Air National Guard -- which performs missions equivalent to those of the Air National Guards of each one of the U.S. states . Ohio - class ballistic missile submarine USS Maryland , Roosevelt Roads Naval Station , 1997 At different times in the 20th century , the U.S. had about 25 military or naval installations in Puerto Rico , some very small ones , as well as large installations . The largest of these installations were the former Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Ceiba , the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility ( AFWTF ) on Vieques , the National Guard training facility at Camp Santiago in Salinas , Fort Allen in Juana Diaz , the Army 's Fort Buchanan in San Juan , the former U.S. Air Force Ramey Air Force Base in Aguadilla , and the Puerto Rico Air National Guard at Muñiz Air Force base in San Juan . The former U.S. Navy facilities at Roosevelt Roads , Vieques , and Sabana Seca have been deactivated and partially turned over to the local government . Other than U.S. Coast Guard and Puerto Rico National Guard facilities , there are only two remaining military installations in Puerto Rico : the U.S. Army 's small Ft. Buchanan ( supporting local veterans and reserve units ) and the PRANG ( Puerto Rico Air National Guard ) Muñiz Air Base ( the C - 130 Fleet ) . In recent years , the U.S. Congress has considered their deactivations , but these have been opposed by diverse public and private entities in Puerto Rico -- such as retired military who rely on Ft. Buchanan for the services available there . Puerto Ricans have participated in many of the military conflicts in which the United States has been involved . For example , they participated in the American Revolution , when volunteers from Puerto Rico , Cuba , and Mexico fought the British in 1779 under the command of General Bernardo de Gálvez ( 1746 -- 1786 ) , and have continued to participate up to the present - day conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan . A significant number of Puerto Ricans participate as members and work for the U.S. Armed Services , largely as National Guard members and civilian employees . The size of the overall military - related community in Puerto Rico is estimated to be 100,000 individuals . This includes retired personnel . Fort Buchanan has about 4,000 military and civilian personnel . In addition , approximately 17,000 people are members of the Puerto Rico Army and Air National Guards , or the U.S. Reserve forces . Puerto Rican soldiers have served in every U.S. military conflict from World War I to the current military engagement known by the United States and its allies as the War against Terrorism . The 65th Infantry Regiment , nicknamed `` The Borinqueneers '' from the original Taíno name of the island ( Borinquen ) , is a Puerto Rican regiment of the United States Army . The regiment 's motto is Honor et Fidelitas , Latin for Honor and Fidelity . The 65th Infantry Regiment participated in World War I , World War II , the Korean War , and the War on Terror and in 2014 was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal , presented by President Barack Obama , for its heroism during the Korean War . Administrative divisions Main article : Municipalities of Puerto Rico There are no counties , as there are in 48 of the 50 United States . There are 78 municipalities . Municipalities are subdivided into barrios , and those into sectors . Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected to four - year terms . A map of Puerto Rico showing its municipalities Economy Main articles : Economy of Puerto Rico and Puerto Rico government - debt crisis Puerto Rico 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) by economic sector The economy of Puerto Rico is classified as a high income economy by the World Bank and as the most competitive economy in Latin America by the World Economic Forum but Puerto Rico currently has a public debt of $72.204 billion ( equivalent to 103 % of GNP ) , and a government deficit of $2.5 billion . According to World Bank , gross national income per capita of Puerto Rico in 2013 is $23,830 ( PPP , International Dollars ) , ranked as 63rd among all sovereign and dependent territories entities in the world . Its economy is mainly driven by manufacturing ( primarily pharmaceuticals , textiles , petrochemicals and electronics ) followed by the service industry ( primarily finance , insurance , real estate and tourism ) . In recent years , the territory has also become a popular destination for MICE ( meetings , incentives , conferencing , exhibitions ) , with a modern convention centre district overlooking the Port of San Juan . The geography of Puerto Rico and its political status are both determining factors on its economic prosperity , primarily due to its relatively small size as an island ; its lack of natural resources used to produce raw materials , and , consequently , its dependence on imports ; as well as its territorial status with the United States , which controls its foreign policy while exerting trading restrictions , particularly in its shipping industry . Puerto Rico experienced a recession from 2006 to 2011 , interrupted by 4 quarters of economic growth , and entered into recession again in 2013 , following growing fiscal imbalance and the expiration of the IRS Section 936 corporate incentives that the U.S. Internal Revenue Code had applied to Puerto Rico . This IRS section was critical to the economy , as it established tax exemptions for U.S. corporations that settled in Puerto Rico , and allowed their insular subsidiaries to send their earnings to the parent corporation at any time , without paying federal tax on corporate income . Puerto Rico has surprisingly been able to maintain a relatively low inflation in the past decade while maintaining a purchasing power parity per capita higher than 80 % of the rest of the world . Academically , most of Puerto Rico 's economic woes stem from federal regulations that expired , have been repealed , or no longer apply to Puerto Rico ; its inability to become self - sufficient and self - sustainable throughout history ; its highly politicized public policy which tends to change whenever a political party gains power ; as well as its highly inefficient local government which has accrued a public debt equal to 68 % of its gross domestic product throughout time . In comparison to the different states of the United States , Puerto Rico is poorer than Mississippi ( the poorest state of the U.S. ) with 41 % of its population below the poverty line . When compared to Latin America , Puerto Rico has the highest GDP per capita in the region . Its main trading partners are the United States itself , Ireland , and Japan , with most products coming from East Asia , mainly from China , Hong Kong , and Taiwan . At a global scale , Puerto Rico 's dependency on oil for transportation and electricity generation , as well as its dependency on food imports and raw materials , makes Puerto Rico volatile and highly reactive to changes in the world economy and climate . Puerto Rico 's agricultural sector represents less than 1 % of GNP . Heavy debt load In early 2017 , the Puerto Rican government - debt crisis posed serious problems for the government which was saddled with outstanding bond debt that had climbed to $70 billion at a time with a 45 percent poverty rate and 12.4 % unemployment that is more than twice the mainland U.S. average . The debt had been increasing during a decade long recession . The Commonwealth had been defaulting on many debts , including bonds , since 2015 . With debt payments due , the Governor was facing the risk of a government shutdown and failure to fund the managed health care system . `` Without action before April , Puerto Rico 's ability to execute contracts for Fiscal Year 2018 with its managed care organizations will be threatened , thereby putting at risk beginning July 1 , 2017 the health care of up to 900,000 poor U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico '' , according to a letter sent to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human Services . They also said that `` Congress must enact measures recommended by both Republicans and Democrats that fix Puerto Rico 's inequitable health care financing structure and promote sustained economic growth . '' Initially , the oversight board created under PROMESA called for Puerto Rico 's governor Ricardo Rosselló to deliver a fiscal turnaround plan by January 28 . Just before that deadline , the control board gave the Commonwealth government until February 28 to present a fiscal plan ( including negotiations with creditors for restructuring debt ) to solve the problems . A moratorium on lawsuits by debtors was extended to May 31 . It is essential for Puerto Rico to reach restructuring deals to avoid a bankruptcy - like process under PROMESA . An internal survey conducted by the Puerto Rican Economists Association revealed that the majority of Puerto Rican economists reject the policy recommendations of the Board and the Rosselló government , with more than 80 % of economists arguing in favor of auditing the debt . In early August 2017 , the island 's financial oversight board ( created by PROMESA ) planned to institute two days off without pay per month for government employees , down from the original plan of four days per month ; the latter had been expected to achieve $218 million in savings . Governor Rossello rejected this plan as unjustified and unnecessary . Pension reforms were also discussed including a proposal for a 10 % reduction in benefits to begin addressing the $50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities . Public finances Main articles : Puerto Rico government - debt crisis , Budget of the Government of Puerto Rico , and public debt of Puerto Rico Puerto Rico has an operating budget of about U.S. $9.8 billion with expenses at about $10.4 billion , creating a structural deficit of $775 million ( about 7.9 % of the budget ) . The practice of approving budgets with a structural deficit has been done for 18 consecutive years starting in 2000 . Throughout those years , including present time , all budgets contemplated issuing bonds to cover these projected deficits rather than making structural adjustments . This practice increased Puerto Rico 's cumulative debt , as the government had already been issuing bonds to balance its actual budget for four decades since 1973 . The 2012 Budget of the Government of Puerto Rico Projected deficits added substantial burdens to an already indebted nation which accrued a public debt of $71 B or about 70 % of Puerto Rico 's gross domestic product . This sparked an ongoing government - debt crisis after Puerto Rico 's general obligation bonds were downgraded to speculative non-investment grade ( `` junk status '' ) by three credit rating agencies . In terms of financial control , almost 9.6 % -- or about $1.5 billion -- of Puerto Rico 's central government budget expenses for FY2014 is expected to be spent on debt service . Harsher budget cuts are expected as Puerto Rico must now repay larger chunks of debts in the following years . For practical reasons the budget is divided into two aspects : a `` general budget '' which comprises the assignments funded exclusively by the Department of Treasury of Puerto Rico , and the `` consolidated budget '' which comprises the assignments funded by the general budget , by Puerto Rico 's government - owned corporations , by revenue expected from loans , by the sale of government bonds , by subsidies extended by the federal government of the United States , and by other funds . Both budgets contrast each other drastically , with the consolidated budget being usually thrice the size of the general budget ; currently $29 B and $9.0 B respectively . Almost one out of every four dollars in the consolidated budget comes from U.S. federal subsidies while government - owned corporations compose more than 31 % of the consolidated budget . The critical aspects come from the sale of bonds , which comprise 7 % of the consolidated budget -- a ratio that increased annually due to the government 's inability to prepare a balanced budget in addition to being incapable of generating enough income to cover all its expenses . In particular , the government - owned corporations add a heavy burden to the overall budget and public debt , as none is self - sufficient . For example , in FY2011 the government - owned corporations reported aggregated losses of more than $1.3 B with the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority ( PRHTA ) reporting losses of $409 M , the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority ( PREPA ; the government monopoly that controls all electricity on the island ) reporting losses of $272 M , while the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority ( PRASA ; the government monopoly that controls all water utilities on the island ) reported losses of $112 M . Losses by government - owned corporations have been defrayed through the issuance of bonds compounding more than 40 % of Puerto Rico 's entire public debt today . Holistically , from FY2000 -- FY2010 Puerto Rico 's debt grew at a compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of 9 % while GDP remained stagnant . This has not always provided a long - term solution . In early July 2017 for example , the PREPA power authority was effectively bankrupt after defaulting in a plan to restructure $9 billion in bond debt ; the agency planned to seek Court protection . In terms of protocol , the governor , together with the Puerto Rico Office of Management and Budget ( OGP in Spanish ) , formulates the budget he believes is required to operate all government branches for the ensuing fiscal year . He then submits this formulation as a budget request to the Puerto Rican legislature before July 1 , the date established by law as the beginning of Puerto Rico 's fiscal year . While the constitution establishes that the request must be submitted `` at the beginning of each regular session '' , the request is typically submitted during the first week of May as the regular sessions of the legislature begin in January and it would be impractical to submit a request so far in advance . Once submitted , the budget is then approved by the legislature , typically with amendments , through a joint resolution and is referred back to the governor for his approval . The governor then either approves it or vetoes it . If vetoed the legislature can then either refer it back with amendments for the governor 's approval , or approve it without the governor 's consent by two - thirds of the bodies of each chamber . Once the budget is approved , the Department of Treasury disburses funds to the Office of Management and Budget which in turn disburses the funds to the respective agencies , while the Puerto Rico Government Development Bank ( the government 's intergovernmental bank ) manages all related banking affairs including those related to the government - owned corporations . Cost of living A map of Jones Act carrier routes for Puerto Rico The cost of living in Puerto Rico is high and has increased over the past decade . San Juan 's in particular is higher than Atlanta , Dallas , and Seattle but lower than Boston , Chicago , and New York City . One factor is housing prices which are comparable to Miami and Los Angeles , although property taxes are considerably lower than most places in the United States . Statistics used for cost of living sometimes do not take into account certain costs , such as the high cost of electricity , which has hovered in the 24 ¢ to 30 ¢ range per kilowatt / hour , two to three times the national average , increased travel costs for longer flights , additional shipping fees , and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers `` outside the continental United States '' . While some online stores do offer free shipping on orders to Puerto Rico , many merchants exclude Hawaii , Alaska , Puerto Rico and other United States territories . The household median income is stated as $19,350 and the mean income as $30,463 in the U.S. Census Bureau 's 2015 update . The report also indicates that 45.5 % of individuals are below the poverty level . The median home value in Puerto Rico ranges from U.S. $100,000 to U.S. $214,000 , while the national median home value sits at $119,600 . One of the most cited contributors to the high cost of living in Puerto Rico is the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 , also known as the Jones Act , which prevents foreign - flagged ships from carrying cargo between two American ports , a practice known as cabotage . Because of the Jones Act , foreign ships inbound with goods from Central and South America , Western Europe , and Africa can not stop in Puerto Rico , offload Puerto Rico - bound goods , load mainland - bound Puerto Rico - manufactured goods , and continue to U.S. ports . Instead , they must proceed directly to U.S. ports , where distributors break bulk and send Puerto Rico - bound manufactured goods to Puerto Rico across the ocean by U.S. - flagged ships . The local government of Puerto Rico has requested several times to the U.S. Congress to exclude Puerto Rico from the Jones Act restrictions without success . The most recent measure has been taken by the 17th Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico through R. Conc . del S. 21 . These measures have always received support from all the major local political parties . In 2013 the Government Accountability Office published a report which concluded that `` repealing or amending the Jones Act cabotage law might cut Puerto Rico shipping costs '' and that `` shippers believed that opening the trade to non-U.S. - flag competition could lower costs '' . However , the same GAO report also found that `` ( shippers ) doing business in Puerto Rico that GAO contacted reported that the freight rates are often -- although not always -- lower for foreign carriers going to and from Puerto Rico and foreign locations than the rates shippers pay to ship similar cargo to and from the United States , despite longer distances . Data were not available to allow us to validate the examples given or verify the extent to which this difference occurred . '' Ultimately , the report concluded that `` ( the ) effects of modifying the application of the Jones Act for Puerto Rico are highly uncertain '' for both Puerto Rico and the United States , particularly for the U.S. shipping industry and the military preparedness of the United States . Education Main article : Education in Puerto Rico The first school in Puerto Rico was the Escuela de Gramática ( Grammar School ) . It was established by Bishop Alonso Manso in 1513 , in the area where the Cathedral of San Juan was to be constructed . The school was free of charge and the courses taught were Latin language , literature , history , science , art , philosophy and theology . Education in Puerto Rico is divided in three levels -- Primary ( elementary school grades 1 -- 6 ) , Secondary ( intermediate and high school grades 7 -- 12 ) , and Higher Level ( undergraduate and graduate studies ) . As of 2002 , the literacy rate of the Puerto Rican population was 94.1 % ; by gender , it was 93.9 % for males and 94.4 % for females . According to the 2000 Census , 60.0 % of the population attained a high school degree or higher level of education , and 18.3 % has a bachelor 's degree or higher . Instruction at the primary school level is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 18 . As of 2010 , there are 1539 public schools and 806 private schools . The largest and oldest university system is the public University of Puerto Rico ( UPR ) with 11 campuses . The largest private university systems on the island are the Sistema Universitario Ana G. Mendez which operates the Universidad del Turabo , Metropolitan University and Universidad del Este . Other private universities include the multi-campus Inter American University , the Pontifical Catholic University , Universidad Politécnica de Puerto Rico , and the Universidad del Sagrado Corazón . Puerto Rico has four schools of Medicine and three ABA - approved Law Schools . Public health and safety As of 2015 medical care in Puerto Rico had been heavily impacted by emigration of doctors to the mainland and underfunding of the Medicare and Medicaid programs which serve 60 % of the island 's population . Affordable medical insurance under the Affordable Care Act is not available in Puerto Rico as , since Puerto Ricans pay no income tax , no subsidies are available . The city of San Juan has a system of triage , hospital , and preventive care health services . The municipal government sponsors regular health fairs in different areas of the city focusing on health care for the elderly and the disabled . In 2017 , there were 69 hospitals in Puerto Rico . There are twenty hospitals in San Juan , half of which are operated by the government . The largest hospital is the Centro Médico de Río Piedras ( the Río Piedras Medical Center ) . Founded in 1956 , it is operated by the Medical Services Administration of the Department of Health of Puerto Rico , and is actually a network of eight hospitals : San Juan Municipal Hospital : This hospital is operated by the San Juan municipal government . Industrial Hospital : This is the hospital for Puerto Rico government employees , whether municipal or Commonwealth government employees . Normally , injured police officers and firefighters are cared for here . San Juan Pediatric Hospital -- Also operated by the San Juan municipal government . Pediatric Hospital : Operated by the government of the Commonwealth , this is the main trauma hospital for pediatric cases . Centro Medico Emergency Room : This is the main hospital for trauma cases for Puerto Rico and the Caribbean . Centro Cardiovascular del Caribe ( Caribbean Cardiovascular Center ) : This is the main hospital for open heart surgery in the Caribbean . It features a hotel for the patients ' families . Psychiatric Hospital : The main psychiatric hospital in Puerto Rico . Operated by the government of Puerto Rico . Psychiatric Correctional Hospital : It is both a hospital and correctional facility . It is operated jointly by the Puerto Rico Department of Corrections and the Medical Services Administration . The city of San Juan operates nine other hospitals . Of these , eight are Diagnostic and Treatment Centers located in communities throughout San Juan . These nine hospitals are : La Perla Puerta de Tierra Llorens Torres Puerto Nuevo San José Río Piedras Sabana Llana Hoare Santurce Parada 19 There are also ten private hospitals in San Juan . These are : Hospital Metropilitano Hospital Auxilio Mutuo Hospital Auxilio Mutuo Expreso Hospital de Veteranos : The main Veterans hospital in the Caribbean . Operated by the U.S. Veteran Healthcare System . Ashford Presbyterian Hospital Hospital Pavia Hato Rey Hospital Pavia Santurce San Jorge Children 's Hospital : The most well known children 's hospital in the San Juan Metropolitan Area . Hospital San Gerardo : Located at the Cupey neighborhood , is a small hospital but is also specialized in psychiatry and elderly . Hospital del Maestro ( Teachers Hospital ) : Located in Hato Rey , this hospital is operated by the Puerto Rico Teachers Association . The city of Ponce is served by several clinics and hospitals . There are four comprehensive care hospitals : Hospital Dr. Pila , Hospital San Cristobal , Hospital San Lucas , and Hospital de Damas . In addition , Hospital Oncológico Andrés Grillasca specializes in the treatment of cancer , and Hospital Siquiátrico specializes in mental disorders . There is also a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic that provides health services to U.S. veterans . The U.S. Veterans Administration will build a new hospital in the city to satisfy regional needs . Hospital de Damas is listed in the U.S. News & World Report as one of the best hospitals under the U.S. flag . Ponce has the highest concentration of medical infrastructure per inhabitant of any municipality in Puerto Rico . On the island of Culebra , there is a small hospital in the island called Hospital de Culebra . It also offers pharmacy services to residents and visitors . For emergencies , patients are transported by plane to Fajardo on the main island . The town of Caguas has three hospitals : Hospital Hima San Pablo , Menonita Caguas Regional Hospital , and the San Juan Bautista Medical Center . The town of Cayey is served by the Hospital Menonita de Cayey , and the Hospital Municipal de Cayey . Reforma de Salud de Puerto Rico ( Puerto Rico Health Reform ) -- locally referred to as La Reforma ( The Reform ) -- is a government - run program which provides medical and health care services to the indigent and impoverished , by means of contracting private health insurance companies , rather than employing government - owned hospitals and emergency centers . The Reform is administered by the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration . Crime See also : Illegal drugs in Puerto Rico The overall rate of crime is low in Puerto Rico . The territory has a high firearm homicide rate . The homicide rate of 19.2 per 100,000 inhabitants was significantly higher than any U.S. state in 2014 . Most homicide victims are gang members and drug traffickers with about 80 % of homicides in Puerto Rico being drug related . Culture Main article : Culture of Puerto Rico Modern Puerto Rican culture is a unique mix of cultural antecedents : including European ( predominantly Spanish , Italian , French , German and Irish ) , African , and , more recently , some North American and lots of South Americans . A large number of Cubans and Dominicans have relocated to the island in the past few decades . From the Spanish , Puerto Rico received the Spanish language , the Catholic religion and the vast majority of their cultural and moral values and traditions . The United States added English - language influence , the university system and the adoption of some holidays and practices . On March 12 , 1903 , the University of Puerto Rico was officially founded , branching out from the `` Escuela Normal Industrial '' , a smaller organization that was founded in Fajardo three years before . Much of Puerto Rican culture centers on the influence of music and has been shaped by other cultures combining with local and traditional rhythms . Early in the history of Puerto Rican music , the influences of Spanish and African traditions were most noticeable . The cultural movements across the Caribbean and North America have played a vital role in the more recent musical influences which have reached Puerto Rico . The official symbols of Puerto Rico are the reinita mora or Puerto Rican spindalis ( a type of bird ) , the flor de maga ( a type of flower ) , and the ceiba or kapok ( a type of tree ) . The unofficial animal and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride is the coquí , a small frog . Other popular symbols of Puerto Rico are the jíbaro ( the `` countryman '' ) , and the carite . Architecture Main article : Architecture of Puerto Rico The architecture of Puerto Rico demonstrates a broad variety of traditions , styles and national influences accumulated over four centuries of Spanish rule , and a century of American rule . Spanish colonial architecture , Ibero - Islamic , art deco , post-modern , and many other architectural forms are visible throughout the island . From town to town , there are also many regional distinctions . Old San Juan Old San Juan is one of the two barrios , in addition to Santurce , that made up the municipality of San Juan from 1864 to 1951 , at which time the former independent municipality of Río Piedras was annexed . With its abundance of shops , historic places , museums , open air cafés , restaurants , gracious homes , tree - shaded plazas , and its old beauty and architectonical peculiarity , Old San Juan is a main spot for local and internal tourism . The district is also characterized by numerous public plazas and churches including San José Church and the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista , which contains the tomb of the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León . It also houses the oldest Catholic school for elementary education in Puerto Rico , the Colegio de Párvulos , built in 1865 . The oldest parts of the district of Old San Juan remain partly enclosed by massive walls . Several defensive structures and notable forts , such as the emblematic Fort San Felipe del Morro , Fort San Cristóbal , and El Palacio de Santa Catalina , also known as La Fortaleza , acted as the primary defenses of the settlement which was subjected to numerous attacks . La Fortaleza continues to serve also as the executive mansion for the Governor of Puerto Rico . Many of the historic fortifications are part of San Juan National Historic Site . During the 1940s , sections of Old San Juan fell into disrepair , and many renovation plans were suggested . There was even a strong push to develop Old San Juan as a `` small Manhattan '' . Strict remodeling codes were implemented to prevent new constructions from affecting the common colonial Spanish architectural themes of the old city . When a project proposal suggested that the old Carmelite Convent in San Juan be demolished to erect a new hotel , the Institute had the building declared as a historic building , and then asked that it be converted to a hotel in a renewed facility . This was what became the Hotel El Convento in Old San Juan . The paradigm to reconstruct and renovate the old city and revitalize it has been followed by other cities in the Americas , particularly Havana , Lima and Cartagena de Indias . Ponce Creole is an architectural style created in Ponce , Puerto Rico , in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . This style of Puerto Rican buildings is found predominantly in residential homes in Ponce that developed between 1895 and 1920 . Ponce Creole architecture borrows heavily from the traditions of the French , the Spaniards , and the Caribbean to create houses that were especially built to withstand the hot and dry climate of the region , and to take advantage of the sun and sea breezes characteristic of the southern Puerto Rico 's Caribbean Sea coast . It is a blend of wood and masonry , incorporating architectural elements of other styles , from Classical revival and Spanish Revival to Victorian . Arts Main article : Puerto Rican art Puerto Rican art reflects many influences , much from its ethnically diverse background . A form of folk art , called santos evolved from the Catholic Church 's use of sculptures to convert indigenous Puerto Ricans to Christianity . Santos depict figures of saints and other religious icons and are made from native wood , clay , and stone . After shaping simple , they are often finished by painting them in vivid colors . Santos vary in size , with the smallest examples around eight inches tall and the largest about twenty inches tall . Traditionally , santos were seen as messengers between the earth and Heaven . As such , they occupied a special place on household altars , where people prayed to them , asked for help , or tried to summon their protection . Also popular , caretas or vejigantes are masks worn during carnivals . Similar masks signifying evil spirits were used in both Spain and Africa , though for different purposes . The Spanish used their masks to frighten lapsed Christians into returning to the church , while tribal Africans used them as protection from the evil spirits they represented . True to their historic origins Puerto Rican caretas always bear at least several horns and fangs . While usually constructed of papier - mâché , coconut shells and fine metal screening are sometimes used as well . Red and black were the typical colors for caretas but their palette has expanded to include a wide variety of bright hues and patterns . Literature Main article : Puerto Rican literature Eugenio María de Hostos Puerto Rican literature evolved from the art of oral story telling to its present - day status . Written works by the native islanders of Puerto Rico were prohibited and repressed by the Spanish colonial government . Only those who were commissioned by the Spanish Crown to document the chronological history of the island were allowed to write . Diego de Torres Vargas was allowed to circumvent this strict prohibition for three reasons : he was a priest , he came from a prosperous Spanish family , and his father was a Sergeant Major in the Spanish Army , who died while defending Puerto Rico from an invasion by the Dutch armada . In 1647 , Torres Vargas wrote Descripción de la Ciudad e Isla de Puerto Rico ( `` Description of the Island and City of Puerto Rico '' ) . This historical book was the first to make a detailed geographic description of the island . The book described all the fruits and commercial establishments of the time , mostly centered in the towns of San Juan and Ponce . The book also listed and described every mine , church , and hospital in the island at the time . The book contained notices on the State and Capital , plus an extensive and erudite bibliography . Descripción de la Ciudad e Isla de Puerto Rico was the first successful attempt at writing a comprehensive history of Puerto Rico . Some of Puerto Rico 's earliest writers were influenced by the teachings of Rafael Cordero . Among these was Dr. Manuel A. Alonso , the first Puerto Rican writer of notable importance . In 1849 he published El Gíbaro , a collection of verses whose main themes were the poor Puerto Rican country farmer . Eugenio María de Hostos wrote La peregrinación de Bayoán in 1863 , which used Bartolomé de las Casas as a spring board to reflect on Caribbean identity . After this first novel , Hostos abandoned fiction in favor of the essay which he saw as offering greater possibilities for inspiring social change . In the late 19th century , with the arrival of the first printing press and the founding of the Royal Academy of Belles Letters , Puerto Rican literature began to flourish . The first writers to express their political views in regard to Spanish colonial rule of the island were journalists . After the United States invaded Puerto Rico during the Spanish -- American War and the island was ceded to the Americans as a condition of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 , writers and poets began to express their opposition to the new colonial rule by writing about patriotic themes . Alejandro Tapia y Rivera , also known as the Father of Puerto Rican Literature , ushered in a new age of historiography with the publication of The Historical Library of Puerto Rico . Cayetano Coll y Toste was another Puerto Rican historian and writer . His work The Indo - Antillano Vocabulary is valuable in understanding the way the Taínos lived . Dr. Manuel Zeno Gandía in 1894 wrote La Charca and told about the harsh life in the remote and mountainous coffee regions in Puerto Rico . Dr. Antonio S. Pedreira , described in his work Insularismo the cultural survival of the Puerto Rican identity after the American invasion . With the Puerto Rican diaspora of the 1940s , Puerto Rican literature was greatly influenced by a phenomenon known as the Nuyorican Movement . Puerto Rican literature continued to flourish and many Puerto Ricans have since distinguished themselves as authors , journalists , poets , novelists , playwrights , screenwriters , essayists and have also stood out in other literary fields . The influence of Puerto Rican literature has transcended the boundaries of the island to the United States and the rest of the world . Over the past fifty years , significant writers include Ed Vega , Luis Rafael Sánchez , Piri Thomas , Giannina Braschi , and Miguel Piñero . Esmeralda Santiago has written an autobiographical trilogy about growing up in modern Puerto Rico as well as an historical novel , Conquistadora , about life on a sugar plantation during the mid-19th century . Media Main article : Media in Puerto Rico The media in Puerto Rico includes local radio stations , television stations and newspapers , the majority of which are conducted in Spanish . There are also three stations of the U.S. Armed Forces Radio and Television Service . Newspapers with daily distribution are El Nuevo Dia , El Vocero and Indice , Metro , and Primera Hora . El Vocero is distributed free of charge as well as Indice and Metro . Newspapers distributed on a weekly or regional basis include Claridad , La Perla del Sur , La Opinion , Vision , and La Estrella del Norte , among others . Several television channels provide local content in the island . These include WIPR - TV , Telemundo , Univision Puerto Rico , WAPA - TV , and WKAQ - TV . Music Main article : Music of Puerto Rico Play media A dancer performs typical bomba choreography . The music of Puerto Rico has evolved as a heterogeneous and dynamic product of diverse cultural resources . The most conspicuous musical sources have been Spain and West Africa , although many aspects of Puerto Rican music reflect origins elsewhere in Europe and the Caribbean and , over the last century , from the U.S. Puerto Rican music culture today comprises a wide and rich variety of genres , ranging from indigenous genres like bomba , plena , aguinaldo , danza and salsa to recent hybrids like reggaeton . Puerto Rico has some national instruments , like the Cuatro ( Spanish for Four ) . The cuatro is a local instrument that was made by the `` Jibaro '' or people from the mountains . Originally , the Cuatro consisted of four steel strings , hence its name , but currently the Cuatro consists of five double steel strings . It is easily confused with a guitar , even by locals . When held upright , from right to left , the strings are G , D , A , E , B . In the realm of classical music , the island hosts two main orchestras , the Orquesta Sinfónica de Puerto Rico and the Orquesta Filarmónica de Puerto Rico . The Casals Festival takes place annually in San Juan , drawing in classical musicians from around the world . With respect to opera , the legendary Puerto Rican tenor Antonio Paoli was so celebrated , that he performed private recitals for Pope Pius X and the Czar Nicholas II of Russia . In 1907 , Paoli was the first operatic artist in world history to record an entire opera -- when he participated in a performance of Pagliacci by Ruggiero Leoncavallo in Milan , Italy . Over the past fifty years , Puerto Rican artists such as Jorge Emmanuelli , Yomo Toro , Ramito , Jose Feliciano , Bobby Capo , Rafael Cortijo , Ismael Rivera , Chayanne , Tito Puente , Eddie Palmieri , Ray Barreto , Dave Valentin , Omar Rodríguez - López , Hector Lavoe , Ricky Martin , Marc Anthony and Luis Fonsi have thrilled audiences around the world . Cuisine Main article : Puerto Rican cuisine Cuchifritos ( Carnitas ) in New York Puerto Rican cuisine has its roots in the cooking traditions and practices of Europe ( Spain ) , Africa and the native Taínos . In the latter part of the 19th century , the cuisine of Puerto Rico was greatly influenced by the United States in the ingredients used in its preparation . Puerto Rican cuisine has transcended the boundaries of the island , and can be found in several countries outside the archipelago . Basic ingredients include grains and legumes , herbs and spices , starchy tropical tubers , vegetables , meat and poultry , seafood and shellfish , and fruits . Main dishes include mofongo , arroz con gandules , pasteles , alcapurrias and pig roast ( or lechón ) . Beverages include maví and piña colada . Desserts include flan , arroz con dulce ( sweet rice pudding ) , piraguas , brazo gitanos , tembleque , polvorones , and dulce de leche . Locals call their cuisine cocina criolla . The traditional Puerto Rican cuisine was well established by the end of the 19th century . By 1848 the first restaurant , La Mallorquina , opened in Old San Juan . El Cocinero Puertorriqueño , the island 's first cookbook was published in 1849 . Plantain `` arañitas '' and `` tostones rellenos '' From the diet of the Taíno people come many tropical roots and tubers like yautía ( taro ) and especially Yuca ( cassava ) , from which thin cracker - like casabe bread is made . Ajicito or cachucha pepper , a slightly hot habanero pepper , recao / culantro ( spiny leaf ) , achiote ( annatto ) , peppers , ají caballero ( the hottest pepper native to Puerto Rico ) , peanuts , guavas , pineapples , jicacos ( cocoplum ) , quenepas ( mamoncillo ) , lerenes ( Guinea arrowroot ) , calabazas ( tropical pumpkins ) , and guanabanas ( soursops ) are all Taíno foods . The Taínos also grew varieties of beans and some maize / corn , but maize was not as dominant in their cooking as it was for the peoples living on the mainland of Mesoamerica . This is due to the frequent hurricanes that Puerto Rico experiences , which destroy crops of maize , leaving more safeguarded plants like conucos ( hills of yuca grown together ) . Spanish / European influence is also seen in Puerto Rican cuisine . Wheat , chickpeas ( garbanzos ) , capers , olives , olive oil , black pepper , onions , garlic , cilantrillo ( cilantro ) , oregano , basil , sugarcane , citrus fruit , eggplant , ham , lard , chicken , beef , pork , and cheese all came to Borikén ( Puerto Rico 's native Taino name ) from Spain . The tradition of cooking complex stews and rice dishes in pots such as rice and beans are also thought to be originally European ( much like Italians , Spaniards , and the British ) . Early Dutch , French , Italian , and Chinese immigrants influenced not only the culture but Puerto Rican cooking as well . This great variety of traditions came together to form La Cocina Criolla . Coconuts , coffee ( brought by the Arabs and Corsos to Yauco from Kafa , Ethiopia ) , okra , yams , sesame seeds , gandules ( pigeon peas in English ) sweet bananas , plantains , other root vegetables and Guinea hen , all come to Puerto Rico from Africa .

Jump up ^ In 1932 , the U.S. Congress officially back - corrected the former Anglicization of Porto Rico into the Spanish name Puerto Rico . It had been using the former spelling in its legislative and judicial records since it acquired the territory . Patricia Gherovici states that both `` Porto Rico '' and `` Puerto Rico '' were used interchangeably in the news media and documentation before , during , and after the U.S. conquest of the island in 1898 . The `` Porto '' spelling , for instance , was used in the Treaty of Paris , but `` Puerto '' was used by The New York Times that same year . Nancy Morris clarifies that `` a curious oversight in the drafting of the Foraker Act caused the name of the island to be officially misspelled '' . However , Gervasio Luis Garcia traces the Anglicized spelling to a National Geographic article from 1899 , after which the spelling was kept by many agencies and entities because of the ethnic and linguistic pride of the English - speaking citizens of the American mainland .

With my vote , I make the initial request to the Federal Government to begin the process of the decolonization through : ( 1 ) Free Association : Puerto Rico should adopt a status outside of the Territory Clause of the Constitution of the United States that recognizes the sovereignty of the People of Puerto Rico . The Free Association would be based on a free and voluntary political association , the specific terms of which shall be agreed upon between the United States and Puerto Rico as sovereign nations . Such agreement would provide the scope of the jurisdictional powers that the People of Puerto Rico agree to confer to the United States and retain all other jurisdictional powers and authorities . Under this option the American citizenship would be subject to negotiation with the United States Government ; ( 2 ) Proclamation of Independence , I demand that the United States Government , in the exercise of its power to dispose of territory , recognize the national sovereignty of Puerto Rico as a completely independent nation and that the United States Congress enact the necessary legislation to initiate the negotiation and transition to the independent nation of Puerto Rico . My vote for Independence also represents my claim to the rights , duties , powers , and prerogatives of independent and democratic republics , my support of Puerto Rican citizenship , and a `` Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation '' between Puerto Rico and the United States after the transition process Jump up ^ Wyss , Jim . `` Will Puerto Rico become the newest star on the American flag ?

It has , for example , been applied to both states and territories . When used in connection with areas under U.S. sovereignty that are not states , the term broadly describes an area that has a constitution of its adoption . Puerto Rico ( Spanish for `` Rich Port '' ) , officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ( Spanish : Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico , lit . `` Free Associated State of Puerto Rico '' ) and briefly called Porto Rico , is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea . An archipelago among the Greater Antilles , Puerto Rico includes the main island of Puerto Rico and a number of smaller ones , such as Mona , Culebra , and Vieques . The capital and most populous city is San Juan . Its official languages are Spanish and English , though Spanish predominates . The island 's population is approximately 3.4 million . Puerto Rico 's history , tropical climate , natural scenery , traditional cuisine , and tax incentives make it a destination for travelers from around the world . Originally populated by the indigenous Taíno people , the island was claimed in 1493 by Christopher Columbus for Spain during his second voyage . Later it endured invasion attempts from the French , Dutch , and British . Four centuries of Spanish colonial government influenced the island 's cultural landscapes with waves of African slaves , Canarian , and Andalusian settlers . In the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary , but strategic role when compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and the mainland parts of New Spain . Spain 's distant administrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century , helping to produce a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined elements from the Native Americans , Africans , and Iberians . In 1898 , following the Spanish -- American War , the United States acquired Puerto Rico under the terms of the Treaty of Paris . The treaty took effect on April 11 , 1899 . Puerto Ricans are by law citizens of the United States and may move freely between the island and the mainland . As it is not a state , Puerto Rico does not have a vote in the United States Congress , which governs the territory with full jurisdiction under the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950 . However , Puerto Rico does have one non-voting member of the House called a Resident Commissioner . As a U.S. territory , American citizens residing in Puerto Rico are disenfranchised at the national level and do not vote for president and vice president of the United States , and do not pay federal income tax on Puerto Rican income . Like other territories and the District of Columbia , Puerto Rico does not have U.S. senators . Congress approved a local constitution in 1952 , allowing U.S. citizens on the territory to elect a governor . A 2012 referendum showed a majority ( 54 % of those who voted ) disagreed with `` the present form of territorial status '' . A second question asking about a new model , had full statehood the preferred option among those who voted for a change of status , although a significant number of people did not answer the second question of the referendum . Another fifth referendum was held on June 11 , 2017 , with `` Statehood '' and `` Independence / Free Association '' initially as the only available choices . At the recommendation of the Department of Justice , an option for the `` current territorial status '' was added . The referendum showed an overwhelming support for statehood , with 97.18 % voting for it , although the voter turnout had a historically low figure of only 22.99 % of the registered voters casting their ballots . In early 2017 , the Puerto Rican government - debt crisis posed serious problems for the government . The outstanding bond debt had climbed to $70 billion at a time with 12.4 % unemployment . The debt had been increasing during a decade long recession . This was the second major financial crisis to affect the island after the Great Depression when the U.S. government , in 1935 , provided relief efforts through the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration . On May 3 , 2017 , Puerto Rico 's financial oversight board in the U.S. District Court for Puerto Rico filed the debt restructuring petition which was made under Title III of PROMESA . By early August 2017 , the debt was $72 billion with a 45 % poverty rate . In late September 2017 , the Category 5 Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico causing devastating damage . The island 's electrical grid was largely destroyed , with repairs expected to take months to complete , provoking the largest power outage in American history . Recovery efforts were somewhat slow in the first few months , and over 200,000 residents had moved to Florida alone by late November 2017 .

Puerto Ricans often call the island Borinquén -- a derivation of Borikén , its indigenous Taíno name , which means `` Land of the Valiant Lord '' . The terms boricua and borincano derive from Borikén and Borinquen respectively , and are commonly used to identify someone of Puerto Rican heritage . The island is also popularly known in Spanish as la isla del encanto , meaning `` the island of enchantment '' . Columbus named the island San Juan Bautista , in honor of Saint John the Baptist , while the capital city was named Ciudad de Puerto Rico ( `` Rich Port City '' ) . Eventually traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico , while San Juan became the name used for the main trading / shipping port and the capital city . The island 's name was changed to `` Porto Rico '' by the United States after the Treaty of Paris of 1898 . The anglicized name was used by the U.S. government and private enterprises . The name was changed back to Puerto Rico by a joint resolution in Congress introduced by Félix Córdova Dávila in 1931 . The official name of the entity in Spanish is Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico ( `` free associated state of Puerto Rico '' ) , while its official English name is Commonwealth of Puerto Rico . History Main article : History of Puerto Rico Pre-columbian era A reconstructed Taíno village at the Tibes Ceremonial Center The ancient history of the archipelago which is now Puerto Rico is not well known . Unlike other indigenous cultures in the New World ( Aztec , Maya and Inca ) which left behind abundant archeological and physical evidence of their societies , scant artifacts and evidence remain of the Puerto Rico 's indigenous population . Scarce archaeological findings and early Spanish accounts from the colonial era constitute all that is known about them . The first comprehensive book on the history of Puerto Rico was written by Fray Íñigo Abbad y Lasierra in 1786 , nearly three centuries after the first Spaniards landed on the island . The first known settlers were the Ortoiroid people , an Archaic Period culture of Amerindian hunters and fishermen who migrated from the South American mainland . Some scholars suggest their settlement dates back about 4,000 years . An archeological dig in 1990 on the island of Vieques found the remains of a man , designated as the `` Puerto Ferro Man '' , which was dated to around 2000 BC . The Ortoiroid were displaced by the Saladoid , a culture from the same region that arrived on the island between 430 and 250 BC . The Igneri tribe migrated to Puerto Rico between 120 and 400 AD from the region of the Orinoco river in northern South America . The Arcaico and Igneri co-existed on the island between the 4th and 10th centuries . Between the 7th and 11th centuries , the Taíno culture developed on the island . By approximately 1000 AD , it had become dominant . At the time of Columbus ' arrival , an estimated 30,000 to 60,000 Taíno Amerindians , led by the cacique ( chief ) Agüeybaná , inhabited the island . They called it Boriken , meaning `` the great land of the valiant and noble Lord '' . The natives lived in small villages , each led by a cacique . They subsisted by hunting and fishing , done generally by men , as well as by the women 's gathering and processing of indigenous cassava root and fruit . This lasted until Columbus arrived in 1493 . Spanish colony ( 1493 -- 1898 ) Further information : Captaincy General of Puerto Rico Juan Ponce de León ( Santervás de Campos , Valladolid , Spain ) , Puerto Rico 's first governor Conquest and early settlement When Columbus arrived in Puerto Rico during his second voyage on November 19 , 1493 , the island was inhabited by the Taíno . They called it Borikén ( Borinquen in Spanish transliteration ) . Columbus named the island San Juan Bautista , in honor of St John the Baptist . Having reported the findings of his first travel , Columbus brought with him this time a letter from King Ferdinand empowered by a papal bull that authorized any course of action necessary for the expansion of the Spanish Empire and the Christian faith . Juan Ponce de León , a lieutenant under Columbus , founded the first Spanish settlement , Caparra , on August 8 , 1508 . He later served as the first governor of the island . Eventually , traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico , and San Juan became the name of the main trading / shipping port . At the beginning of the 16th century , the Spanish people began to colonize the island . Despite the Laws of Burgos of 1512 and other decrees for the protection of the indigenous population , some Taíno Indians were forced into an encomienda system of forced labor in the early years of colonization . The population suffered extremely high fatalities from epidemics of European infectious diseases . Colonization , the habsburgs In 1520 , King Charles I of Spain issued a royal decree collectively emancipating the remaining Taíno population . By that time , the Taíno people were few in number . Enslaved Africans had already begun to be imported to compensate for the native labor loss , but their numbers were proportionate to the diminished commercial interest Spain soon began to demonstrate for the island colony . Other nearby islands , like Cuba , Saint - Domingue , and Guadeloupe , attracted more of the slave trade than Puerto Rico , probably because of greater agricultural interests in those islands , on which colonists had developed large sugar plantations and had the capital to invest in the Atlantic slave trade . From the beginning of the country , the colonial administration relied heavily on the industry of enslaved Africans and creole blacks for public works and defenses , primarily in coastal ports and cities , where the tiny colonial population had hunkered down . With no significant industries or large - scale agricultural production as yet , enslaved and free communities lodged around the few littoral settlements , particularly around San Juan , also forming lasting Afro - creole communities . Meanwhile , in the island 's interior , there developed a mixed and independent peasantry that relied on a subsistence economy . This mostly unsupervised population supplied villages and settlements with foodstuffs and , in relative isolation , set the pattern for what later would be known as the Puerto Rican Jíbaro culture . By the end of the 16th century , the Spanish Empire was diminishing and , in the face of increasing raids from European competitors , the colonial administration throughout the Americas fell into a `` bunker mentality '' . Imperial strategists and urban planners redesigned port settlements into military posts with the objective of protecting Spanish territorial claims and ensuring the safe passing of the king 's silver - laden Atlantic Fleet to the Iberian Peninsula . San Juan served as an important port - of - call for ships driven across the Atlantic by its powerful trade winds . West Indies convoys linked Spain to the island , sailing between Cádiz and the Spanish West Indies . The colony 's seat of government was on the forested Islet of San Juan and for a time became one of the most heavily fortified settlements in the Spanish Caribbean earning the name of the `` Walled City '' . The islet is still dotted with the various forts and walls , such as La Fortaleza , Castillo San Felipe del Morro , and Castillo San Cristóbal , designed to protect the population and the strategic Port of San Juan from the raids of the Spanish European competitors . Hendricksz 1625 attack on San Juan , Puerto Rico In 1625 , in the Battle of San Juan , the Dutch commander Boudewijn Hendricksz tested the defenses ' limits like no one else before . Learning from Francis Drake 's previous failures here , he circumvented the cannons of the castle of San Felipe del Morro and quickly brought his 17 ships into the San Juan Bay . He then occupied the port and attacked the city while the population hurried for shelter behind the Morro 's moat and high battlements . Historians consider this event the worst attack on San Juan . Though the Dutch set the village on fire , they failed to conquer the Morro , and its batteries pounded their troops and ships until Hendricksz deemed the cause lost . Hendricksz 's expedition eventually helped propel a fortification frenzy . Constructions of defenses for the San Cristóbal Hill were soon ordered so as to prevent the landing of invaders out of reach of the Morro 's artillery . Urban planning responded to the needs of keeping the colony in Spanish hands . Late colonial period Hacienda La Fortuna . A sugar mill complex in Puerto Rico painted by Francisco Oller in 1885 ( Brooklyn Museum ) During the late 16th and early 17th centuries , Spain concentrated its colonial efforts on the more prosperous mainland North , Central , and South American colonies . With the advent of the lively Bourbon Dynasty in Spain in the 1700s , the island of Puerto Rico began a gradual shift to more imperial attention . More roads began connecting previously isolated inland settlements to coastal cities , and coastal settlements like Arecibo , Mayaguez , and Ponce began acquiring importance of their own , separate from San Juan . By the end of the 18th century , merchant ships from an array of nationalities threatened the tight regulations of the Mercantilist system , which turned each colony solely toward the European metropole and limited contact with other nations . U.S. ships came to surpass Spanish trade and with this also came the exploitation of the island 's natural resources . Slavers , which had made but few stops on the island before , began selling more enslaved Africans to growing sugar and coffee plantations . The increasing number of Atlantic wars in which the Caribbean islands played major roles , like the War of Jenkins ' Ear , the Seven Years ' War and the Atlantic Revolutions , ensured Puerto Rico 's growing esteem in Madrid 's eyes . On April 17 , 1797 , Sir Ralph Abercromby 's fleet invaded the island with a force of 6,000 -- 13,000 men , which included German soldiers and Royal Marines and 60 to 64 ships . Fierce fighting continued for the next days with Spanish troops . Both sides suffered heavy losses . On Sunday April 30 the British ceased their attack and began their retreat from San Juan . By the time independence movements in the larger Spanish colonies gained success , new waves of loyal creole immigrants began to arrive in Puerto Rico , helping to tilt the island 's political balance toward the Crown . The 16th - century fort , Castillo San Felipe del Morro , in San Juan , Puerto Rico In 1809 , to secure its political bond with the island and in the midst of the European Peninsular War , the Supreme Central Junta based in Cádiz recognized Puerto Rico as an overseas province of Spain . This gave the island residents the right to elect representatives to the recently convened Spanish parliament ( Cádiz Cortes ) , with equal representation to mainland Iberian , Mediterranean ( Balearic Islands ) and Atlantic maritime Spanish provinces ( Canary Islands ) . Ramón Power y Giralt , the first Spanish parliamentary representative from the island of Puerto Rico , died after serving a three - year term in the Cortes . These parliamentary and constitutional reforms were in force from 1810 to 1814 , and again from 1820 to 1823 . They were twice reversed during the restoration of the traditional monarchy by Ferdinand VII . Immigration and commercial trade reforms in the 19th century increased the island 's ethnic European population and economy and expanded the Spanish cultural and social imprint on the local character of the island . Minor slave revolts had occurred on the island throughout the years , with the revolt planned and organized by Marcos Xiorro in 1821 being the most important . Even though the conspiracy was unsuccessful , Xiorro achieved legendary status and is part of Puerto Rico 's folklore . Politics of liberalism The flag flown by Fidel Vélez and his men during the `` Intentona de Yauco '' revolt In the early 19th century , Puerto Rico spawned an independence movement that , due to harsh persecution by the Spanish authorities , convened in the island of St. Thomas . The movement was largely inspired by the ideals of Simón Bolívar in establishing a United Provinces of New Granada and Venezuela , that included Puerto Rico and Cuba . Among the influential members of this movement were Brigadier General Antonio Valero de Bernabé and María de las Mercedes Barbudo . The movement was discovered , and Governor Miguel de la Torre had its members imprisoned or exiled . With the increasingly rapid growth of independent former Spanish colonies in the South and Central American states in the first part of the 19th century , the Spanish Crown considered Puerto Rico and Cuba of strategic importance . To increase its hold on its last two New World colonies , the Spanish Crown revived the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815 as a result of which 450,000 immigrants , mainly Spaniards , settled on the island in the period up until the American conquest . Printed in three languages -- Spanish , English , and French -- it was intended to also attract non-Spanish Europeans , with the hope that the independence movements would lose their popularity if new settlers had stronger ties to the Crown . Hundreds of non Spanish families , mainly from Corsica , France , Germany , Ireland , Italy and Scotland , also immigrated to the island . Free land was offered as an incentive to those who wanted to populate the two islands , on the condition that they swear their loyalty to the Spanish Crown and allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church . The offer was very successful , and European immigration continued even after 1898 . Puerto Rico still receives Spanish and European immigration . The Lares Revolutionary Flag Poverty and political estrangement with Spain led to a small but significant uprising in 1868 known as Grito de Lares . It began in the rural town of Lares , but was subdued when rebels moved to the neighboring town of San Sebastián . Leaders of this independence movement included Ramón Emeterio Betances , considered the `` father '' of the Puerto Rican independence movement , and other political figures such as Segundo Ruiz Belvis . Slavery was abolished in Puerto Rico in 1873 , `` with provisions for periods of apprenticeship '' . Abolition Park in Ponce , Puerto Rico Leaders of `` El Grito de Lares '' went into exile in New York City . Many joined the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee , founded on December 8 , 1895 , and continued their quest for Puerto Rican independence . In 1897 , Antonio Mattei Lluberas and the local leaders of the independence movement in Yauco organized another uprising , which became known as the Intentona de Yauco . They raised what they called the Puerto Rican flag , which was adopted as the national flag . The local conservative political factions opposed independence . Rumors of the planned event spread to the local Spanish authorities who acted swiftly and put an end to what would be the last major uprising in the island to Spanish colonial rule . In 1897 , Luis Muñoz Rivera and others persuaded the liberal Spanish government to agree to grant limited self - government to the island by royal decree in the Autonomic Charter , including a bicameral legislature . In 1898 , Puerto Rico 's first , but short - lived , quasi-autonomous government was organized as an `` overseas province '' of Spain . This bilaterally agreed - upon charter maintained a governor appointed by the King of Spain -- who held the power to annul any legislative decision -- and a partially elected parliamentary structure . In February , Governor - General Manuel Macías inaugurated the new government under the Autonomic Charter . General elections were held in March and the new government began to function on July 17 , 1898 . American era ( 1898 -- present ) Main article : Puerto Rican Campaign In 1890 , Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan , a member of the Navy War Board and leading U.S. strategic thinker , published a book titled The Influence of Sea Power upon History in which he argued for the establishment of a large and powerful navy modeled after the British Royal Navy . Part of his strategy called for the acquisition of colonies in the Caribbean , which would serve as coaling and naval stations . They would serve as strategic points of defense with the construction of a canal through the Isthmus of Panama , to allow easier passage of ships between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans . The first company of Puerto Ricans enlisted in the U.S. Army , 1899 William H. Seward , the former Secretary of State under presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson , had also stressed the importance of building a canal in Honduras , Nicaragua or Panama . He suggested that the United States annex the Dominican Republic and purchase Puerto Rico and Cuba . The U.S. Senate did not approve his annexation proposal , and Spain rejected the U.S. offer of 160 million dollars for Puerto Rico and Cuba . Since 1894 , the United States Naval War College had been developing contingency plans for a war with Spain . By 1896 , the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence had prepared a plan that included military operations in Puerto Rican waters . Except for one 1895 plan , which recommended annexation of the island then named Isle of Pines ( later renamed as Isla de la Juventud ) , a recommendation dropped in later planning , plans developed for attacks on Spanish territories were intended as support operations against Spain 's forces in and around Cuba . Recent research suggests that the U.S. did consider Puerto Rico valuable as a naval station , and recognized that it and Cuba generated lucrative crops of sugar -- a valuable commercial commodity which the United States lacked , before the development of the Sugar Beet industry in the United States . Children in a company housing settlement , 1941 On July 25 , 1898 , during the Spanish -- American War , the U.S. invaded Puerto Rico with a landing at Guánica . As an outcome of the war , Spain ceded Puerto Rico , along with the Philippines and Guam , then under Spanish sovereignty , to the U.S. under the Treaty of Paris , which went into effect on April 11 , 1899 . Spain relinquished sovereignty over Cuba , but did not cede it to the U.S. United States unincorporated organized territory ( 1900 -- 1952 ) The United States and Puerto Rico began a long - standing metropolis - colony relationship . In the early 20th century , Puerto Rico was ruled by the military , with officials including the governor appointed by the President of the United States . The Foraker Act of 1900 gave Puerto Rico a certain amount of civilian popular government , including a popularly elected House of Representatives . The upper house and governor were appointed by the United States . The First Supreme Court of Puerto Rico , appointed pursuant to the Foraker Act Its judicial system was constructed to follow the American legal system ; a Puerto Rico Supreme Court and a United State District Court for the territory were established . It was authorized a non-voting member of Congress , by the title of `` Resident Commissioner '' , who was appointed . In addition , this Act extended all U.S. laws `` not locally inapplicable '' to Puerto Rico , specifying , in particular , exemption from U.S. Internal Revenue laws . The Act empowered the civil government to legislate on `` all matters of legislative character not locally inapplicable '' , including the power to modify and repeal any laws then in existence in Puerto Rico , though the U.S. Congress retained the power to annul acts of the Puerto Rico legislature . During an address to the Puerto Rican legislature in 1906 , President Theodore Roosevelt recommended that Puerto Ricans become U.S. citizens . In 1914 , the Puerto Rican House of Delegates voted unanimously in favor of independence from the United States , but this was rejected by the U.S. Congress as `` unconstitutional '' , and in violation of the 1900 Foraker Act . U.S. citizenship and Puerto Rican citizenship In 1917 , the U.S. Congress passed the Jones -- Shafroth Act , popularly called the Jones Act , which granted Puerto Ricans , born on or after , April 25 , 1898 , U.S. citizenship . Opponents , which included all of the Puerto Rican House of Delegates , who voted unanimously against it , said that the U.S. imposed citizenship in order to draft Puerto Rican men into the army as American entry into World War I became likely . The same Act provided for a popularly elected Senate to complete a bicameral Legislative Assembly , as well as a bill of rights . It authorized the popular election of the Resident Commissioner to a four - year term . Soldiers of the 65th Infantry training in Salinas , Puerto Rico ( August 1941 ) Natural disasters , including a major earthquake and tsunami in 1918 , and several hurricanes , and the Great Depression impoverished the island during the first few decades under U.S. rule . Some political leaders , such as Pedro Albizu Campos , who led the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party , demanded change in relations with the United States . He organized a protest at the University of Puerto Rico in 1935 , in which four were killed by police . In 1936 , U.S. Senator Millard Tydings introduced a bill supporting independence for Puerto Rico , but it was opposed by Luis Muñoz Marín of the Liberal Party of Puerto Rico . ( Tydings had co-sponsored the Tydings -- McDuffie Act , which provided independence to the Philippines after a 10 - year transition under a limited autonomy . ) All the Puerto Rican parties supported the bill , but Muñoz Marín opposed it . Tydings did not gain passage of the bill . In 1937 , Albizu Campos ' party organized a protest in which numerous people were killed by police in Ponce . The Insular Police , resembling the National Guard , opened fire upon unarmed cadets and bystanders alike . The attack on unarmed protesters was reported by the U.S. Congressman Vito Marcantonio and confirmed by the report of the Hays Commission , which investigated the events . The commission was led by Arthur Garfield Hays , counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union . Nineteen people were killed and over 200 were badly wounded , many in their backs while running away . The Hays Commission declared it a massacre and police mob action , and it has since been known as the Ponce massacre . In the aftermath , on April 2 , 1943 , Tydings introduced a bill in Congress calling for independence for Puerto Rico . This bill ultimately was defeated . During the latter years of the Roosevelt -- Truman administrations , the internal governance was changed in a compromise reached with Luis Muñoz Marín and other Puerto Rican leaders . In 1946 , President Truman appointed the first Puerto Rican - born governor , Jesús T. Piñero . Since 2007 , the Puerto Rico State Department has developed a protocol to issue certificates of Puerto Rican citizenship to Puerto Ricans . In order to be eligible , applicants must have been born in Puerto Rico ; born outside of Puerto Rico to a Puerto Rican -- born parent ; or be an American citizen with at least one year of residence in Puerto Rico . United States unincorporated organized territory with Commonwealth Constitution ( 1952 -- present ) In 1947 , the U.S. granted Puerto Ricans the right to democratically elect their own governor . In 1948 , Luis Muñoz Marín became the first popularly elected governor of Puerto Rico . Painting of bayonet charge by the U.S. 65th Infantry Regiment , made up of Puerto Rican troops , against a Chinese division during the Korean War A bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and nationalist movements in the island . The Senate at the time was controlled by the Popular Democratic Party ( PPD ) , and was presided over by Luis Muñoz Marín . The bill , also known as the Gag Law ( Spanish : Ley de la Mordaza ) , was approved by the legislature on May 21 , 1948 . It made it illegal to display a Puerto Rican flag , to sing a pro-independence tune , to talk of independence , or to campaign for independence . The bill , which resembled the Smith Act passed in the United States , was signed and made into law on June 10 , 1948 , by the U.S. appointed governor of Puerto Rico , Jesús T. Piñero , and became known as `` Law 53 '' ( Spanish : Ley 53 ) . In accordance with this law , it would be a crime to print , publish , sell , exhibit , organize or help anyone organize any society , group or assembly of people whose intentions are to paralyze or destroy the insular government . Anyone accused and found guilty of disobeying the law could be sentenced to ten years of prison , be fined $10,000 ( U.S. ) , or both . According to Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa , a member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives , the law was repressive and in violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution , which guarantees Freedom of Speech . He asserted that the law as such was a violation of the civil rights of the people of Puerto Rico . The law was repealed in 1957 . Estado Libre Asociado In 1950 , the U.S. Congress granted Puerto Ricans the right to organize a constitutional convention via a referendum that gave them the option of voting their preference , `` yes '' or `` no '' , on a proposed U.S. law that would organize Puerto Rico as a `` commonwealth '' that would continue United States sovereignty over Puerto Rico and its people . Puerto Rico 's electorate expressed its support for this measure in 1951 with a second referendum to ratify the constitution . The Constitution of Puerto Rico was formally adopted on July 3 , 1952 . The Constitutional Convention specified the name by which the body politic would be known . On February 4 , 1952 , the convention approved Resolution 22 which chose in English the word Commonwealth , meaning a `` politically organized community '' or `` state '' , which is simultaneously connected by a compact or treaty to another political system . Puerto Rico officially designates itself with the term `` Commonwealth of Puerto Rico '' in its constitution , as a translation into English of the term to `` Estado Libre Asociado '' ( ELA ) . In 1967 Puerto Rico 's Legislative Assembly polled the political preferences of the Puerto Rican electorate by passing a plebiscite act that provided for a vote on the status of Puerto Rico . This constituted the first plebiscite by the Legislature for a choice among three status options ( commonwealth , statehood , and independence ) . In subsequent plebiscites organized by Puerto Rico held in 1993 and 1998 ( without any formal commitment on the part of the U.S. Government to honor the results ) , the current political status failed to receive majority support . In 1993 , Commonwealth status won by a plurality of votes ( 48.6 % versus 46.3 % for statehood ) , while the `` none of the above '' option , which was the Popular Democratic Party - sponsored choice , won in 1998 with 50.3 % of the votes ( versus 46.5 % for statehood ) . Disputes arose as to the definition of each of the ballot alternatives , and Commonwealth advocates , among others , reportedly urged a vote for `` none of the above '' . In 1950 , the U.S. Congress approved Public Law 600 ( P.L. 81 - 600 ) , which allowed for a democratic referendum in Puerto Rico to determine whether Puerto Ricans desired to draft their own local constitution . This Act was meant to be adopted in the `` nature of a compact '' . It required congressional approval of the Puerto Rico Constitution before it could go into effect , and repealed certain sections of the Organic Act of 1917 . The sections of this statute left in force were entitled the Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act . U.S. Secretary of the Interior Oscar L. Chapman , under whose Department resided responsibility of Puerto Rican affairs , clarified the new commonwealth status in this manner : `` The bill ( to permit Puerto Rico to write its own constitution ) merely authorizes the people of Puerto Rico to adopt their own constitution and to organize a local government ... The bill under consideration would not change Puerto Rico 's political , social , and economic relationship to the United States . '' External video Puerto Rico , U.S. Embassy in Vienna , October 24 , 2014 View newsreel scenes in Spanish of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s on YouTube On October 30 , 1950 , Pedro Albizu Campos and other nationalists led a three - day revolt against the United States in various cities and towns of Puerto Rico , in what is known as the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s . The most notable occurred in Jayuya and Utuado . In the Jayuya revolt , known as the Jayuya Uprising , the Puerto Rican governor declared martial law , and attacked the insurgents in Jayuya with infantry , artillery and bombers under control of the Puerto Rican commander . The Utuado uprising culminated in what is known as the Utuado massacre . On November 1 , 1950 , Puerto Rican nationalists from New York City , Griselio Torresola and Oscar Collazo , attempted to assassinate President Harry S. Truman at his temporary residence of Blair House . Torresola was killed during the attack , but Collazo was wounded and captured . He was convicted of murder and sentenced to death , but President Truman commuted his sentence to life . After Collazo served 29 years in a federal prison , President Jimmy Carter commuted his sentence to times served and he was released in 1979 . Pedro Albizu Campos served many years in a federal prison in Atlanta , for seditious conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. government in Puerto Rico . The Constitution of Puerto Rico was approved by a Constitutional Convention on February 6 , 1952 , and 82 % of the voters in a March referendum . It was modified and ratified by the U.S. Congress , approved by President Truman on July 3 of that year , and proclaimed by Gov. Muñoz Marín on July 25 , 1952 . This was the anniversary of July 25 , 1898 , landing of U.S. troops in the Puerto Rican Campaign of the Spanish -- American War , until then celebrated as an annual Puerto Rico holiday . A shantytown along the Martin Peña Channel ( 1973 ) Puerto Rico adopted the name of Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico ( literally `` Associated Free State of Puerto Rico '' ) , officially translated into English as Commonwealth , for its body politic . `` The United States Congress legislates over many fundamental aspects of Puerto Rican life , including citizenship , the currency , the postal service , foreign policy , military defense , communications , labor relations , the environment , commerce , finance , health and welfare , and many others . '' During the 1950s and 1960s , Puerto Rico experienced rapid industrialization , due in large part to Operación Manos a la Obra ( `` Operation Bootstrap '' ) , an offshoot of FDR 's New Deal . It was intended to transform Puerto Rico 's economy from agriculture - based to manufacturing - based to provide more jobs . Puerto Rico has become a major tourist destination , as well as a global center for pharmaceutical manufacturing . Referendums on statehood or independence Four referendums have been held since the late 20th century to resolve the political status . The 2012 referendum showed a majority ( 54 % of the voters ) in favor of a change in status , with full statehood the preferred option of those who wanted a change . Because there were almost 500,000 blank ballots in the 2012 referendum , creating confusion as to the voters ' true desire , Congress decided to ignore the vote . The first three plebiscites provided voters with three options : statehood , free association , and independence . The Puerto Rican status referendum , 2017 in June 2017 was going to offer only two options : Statehood and Independence / Free Association . However , a letter from the Donald Trump administration recommended adding the Commonwealth , the current status , in the plebiscite . The option had been removed from this plebiscite in response to the results of the plebiscite in 2012 which asked whether to remain in the current status and No had won . The Trump administration cited changes in demographics during the past 5 years to add the option once again . Amendments to the plebiscite bill were adopted making ballot wording changes requested by the Department of Justice , as well as adding a `` current territorial status '' option . While 97 percent voted in favor of statehood , the turnout was low ; only some 23 percent voted . After the ballots were counted the Justice Department was non-committal . The Justice Department had asked for the 2017 plebiscite to be postponed but the Rosselló government chose not to do so . After the outcome was announced , the department told the Associated Press that it had `` not reviewed or approved the ballot 's language '' . Former Governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá ( 2005 -- 2009 ) is convinced that statehood is not the solution for either the U.S. or for Puerto Rico `` for economic , identity and cultural reasons '' . He pointed out that voter turnout for the 2017 referendum was extremely low , and suggests that a different type of mutually - beneficial relationship should be found . If the federal government agrees to discuss an association agreement , the conditions would be negotiated between the two entities . The agreement might cover topics such as the role of the U.S. military in Puerto Rico , the use of the U.S. currency , free trade between the two entities , and whether Puerto Ricans would be U.S. citizens . The three current Free Associated States ( Marshall Islands , Micronesia and Palau ) use the American dollar , receive some financial support and the promise of military defense if they refuse military access to any other country . Their citizens are allowed to work in the U.S. and serve in its military . Governor Ricardo Rosselló is strongly in favor of statehood to help develop the economy and help to `` solve our 500 - year - old colonial dilemma ... Colonialism is not an option ... It 's a civil rights issue ... 3.5 million citizens seeking an absolute democracy , '' he told the news media . Benefits of statehood include an additional $10 billion per year in federal funds , the right to vote in presidential elections , higher Social Security and Medicare benefits , and a right for its government agencies and municipalities to file for bankruptcy . The latter is currently prohibited . Statehood might be useful as a means of dealing with the financial crisis , since it would allow for bankruptcy and the relevant protection . According to the Government Development Bank , this might be the only solution to the debt crisis . Congress has the power to vote to allow Chapter 9 protection without the need for statehood , but in late 2015 there was very little support in the House for this concept . Other benefits to statehood include increased disability benefits and Medicaid funding , the right to vote in Presidential elections and the higher ( federal ) minimum wage . Subsequent to the 2017 referendum , Puerto Rico 's legislators are also expected to vote on a bill that would allow the Governor to draft a state constitution and hold elections to choose senators and representatives to the federal Congress . In spite of the outcome of the referendum , and the so - called Tennessee Plan ( above ) , action by the United States Congress would be necessary to implement changes to the status of Puerto Rico under the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution . United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization Since 1953 , the UN has been considering the political status of Puerto Rico and how to assist it in achieving `` independence '' or `` decolonization '' . In 1978 , the Special Committee determined that a `` colonial relationship '' existed between the U.S. and Puerto Rico . The UN 's Special Committee on Decolonization has often referred to Puerto Rico as a `` nation '' in its reports , because , internationally , the people of Puerto Rico are often considered to be a Caribbean nation with their own national identity . Most recently , in a June 2016 report , the Special Committee called for the United States to expedite the process to allow self - determination in Puerto Rico . More specifically , the group called on the United States to expedite a process that would allow the people of Puerto Rico to exercise fully their right to self - determination and independence ... allow the Puerto Rican people to take decisions in a sovereign manner , and to address their urgent economic and social needs , including unemployment , marginalization , insolvency and poverty `` . International status On November 27 , 1953 , shortly after the establishment of the Commonwealth , the General Assembly of the United Nations approved Resolution 748 , removing Puerto Rico 's classification as a non-self - governing territory . The General Assembly did not apply the full list of criteria which was enunciated in 1960 when it took favorable note of the cessation of transmission of information regarding the non-self - governing status of Puerto Rico . According to the White House Task Force on Puerto Rico 's Political Status in its December 21 , 2007 report , the U.S. , in its written submission to the UN in 1953 , never represented that Congress could not change its relationship with Puerto Rico without the territory 's consent . It stated that the U.S. Justice Department in 1959 reiterated that Congress held power over Puerto Rico pursuant to the Territorial Clause of the U.S. Constitution . In 1993 the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit stated that Congress may unilaterally repeal the Puerto Rican Constitution or the Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act and replace them with any rules or regulations of its choice . In a 1996 report on a Puerto Rico status political bill , the U.S. House Committee on Resources stated , `` Puerto Rico 's current status does not meet the criteria for any of the options for full self - government under Resolution 1541 '' ( the three established forms of full self - government being stated in the report as ( 1 ) national independence , ( 2 ) free association based on separate sovereignty , or ( 3 ) full integration with another nation on the basis of equality ) . The report concluded that Puerto Rico `` ... remains an unincorporated colony and does not have the status of ' free association ' with the United States as that status is defined under United States law or international practice '' , that the establishment of local self - government with the consent of the people can be unilaterally revoked by the U.S. Congress , and that U.S. Congress can also withdraw the U.S. citizenship of Puerto Rican residents of Puerto Rico at any time , for a legitimate Federal purpose . The application of the U.S. Constitution to Puerto Rico is limited by the Insular Cases . In 2006 , 2007 , 2009 , 2010 , and 2011 the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization passed resolutions calling on the United States to expedite a process `` that would allow Puerto Ricans to fully exercise their inalienable right to self - determination and independence '' , and to release all Puerto Rican political prisoners in U.S. prisons , to clean up , decontaminate and return the lands in the islands of Vieques and Culebra to the people of Puerto Rico , to perform a probe into U.S. human rights violations on the island and a probe into the killing by the FBI of pro-independence leader Filiberto Ojeda Rios . 21st century Further information : Proposed political status for Puerto Rico ; Puerto Rican status referendum , 2012 ; and President 's Task Force on Puerto Rico 's Status Puerto Rican status referendum , 2012 Location Puerto Rico Date November 6 , 2012 ; 5 years ago ( 2012 - 11 - 06 ) Voting system simple majority for the first question first - past - the - post for the second question Should Puerto Rico continue its current territorial status ? Yes 46.00 % No 54.00 % Which non-territorial option do you prefer ? Statehood 61.16 % Sovereign Free Associated State 33.34 % Independence 5.49 % There were 515,348 blank and invalidated ballots counted alongside the 1,363,854 ballots which indicated a choice for one of the non-territorial alternatives . Under Puerto Rico Law , these ballots are not considered cast votes and are therefore not reflected in the final tally . On July 15 , 2009 , the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization approved a draft resolution calling on the Government of the United States to expedite a process that would allow the Puerto Rican people to exercise fully their inalienable right to self - determination and independence . On April 29 , 2010 , the U.S. House voted 223 -- 169 to approve a measure for a federally sanctioned process for Puerto Rico 's self - determination , allowing Puerto Rico to set a new referendum on whether to continue its present form of commonwealth , or to have a different political status . If Puerto Ricans voted to continue as a commonwealth , the Government of Puerto Rico was authorized to conduct additional plebiscites at intervals of every eight years from the date on which the results of the prior plebiscite were certified ; if Puerto Ricans voted to have a different political status , a second referendum would determine whether Puerto Rico would become a U.S. state , an independent country , or a sovereign nation associated with the U.S. that would not be subject to the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution . During the House debate , a fourth option , to retain its present form of commonwealth ( sometimes referred to as `` the status quo '' ) political status , was added as an option in the second plebiscite . Immediately following U.S. House passage , H.R. 2499 was sent to the U.S. Senate , where it was given two formal readings and referred to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources . On December 22 , 2010 , the 111th United States Congress adjourned without any Senate vote on H.R. 2499 , killing the bill . The latest Task Force report was released on March 11 , 2011 . The report suggested a two - plebiscite process , including a `` first plebiscite that requires the people of Puerto Rico to choose whether they wish to be part of the United States ( either via Statehood or Commonwealth ) or wish to be independent ( via Independence or Free Association ) . If continuing to be part of the United States were chosen in the first plebiscite , a second vote would be taken between Statehood and Commonwealth . '' On June 14 , 2011 , President Barack Obama `` promised to support ' a clear decision ' by the people of Puerto Rico on statehood '' . That same month , the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization passed a resolution and adopted a consensus text introduced by Cuba 's delegate on June 20 , 2011 , calling on the United States to expedite a process `` that would allow Puerto Ricans to fully exercise their inalienable right to self - determination and independence '' . On November 6 , 2012 , a two - question referendum took place , simultaneous with the general elections . The first question asked voters whether they wanted to maintain the current status under the territorial clause of the U.S. Constitution . The second question posed three alternate status options if the first question was approved : statehood , independence or free association . For the first question , 54 percent voted against the current Commonwealth status . For the second question , 61.16 % voted for statehood , 33.34 % for a sovereign free associated state , and 5.49 % for independence . There were also 515,348 blank and invalidated ballots , which are not reflected in the final tally , as they are not considered cast votes under Puerto Rico law . On December 11 , 2012 , Puerto Rico 's Legislature passed a concurrent resolution to request to the President and the U.S. Congress action on November 6 , 2012 plebiscite results . But on April 10 , 2013 , with the issue still being widely debated , the White House announced that it will seek $2.5 million to hold another referendum , this next one being the first Puerto Rican status referendum to be financed by the U.S. Federal government . In December 2015 , the U.S. Government submitted a brief as Amicus Curiae to the U.S. Supreme Court related to the case Commonwealth of Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle . The U.S. Government official position is that the U.S. Constitution does not contemplate `` sovereign territories '' . That the Court has consistently recognized that `` there is no sovereignty in a Territory of the United States but that of the United States itself '' . and a U.S. territory has `` no independent sovereignty comparable to that of a state . That is because `` the Government of a territory owes its existence wholly to the United States '' . Congress 's plenary authority over federal territories includes the authority to permit self - government , whereby local officials administer a territory 's internal affairs . On June 9 , 2016 , in Commonwealth of Puerto Rico vs Sanchez Valle , a 6 -- 2 majority of the Supreme Court of the United States determined that Puerto Rico is a territory and lacks Sovereignty . On June 30 , 2016 , the President of the United States of America signed a new law approved by U.S. Congress , H.R. 5278 : PROMESA , establishing a Control Board over the Puerto Rico Government . This board will have a significant degree of federal control involved in its establishment and operations . In particular , the authority to establish the control board derives from the federal government 's constitutional power to `` make all needful rules and regulations '' regarding U.S. territories ; The President would appoint all seven voting members of the board ; and the board would have broad sovereign powers to effectively overrule decisions by Puerto Rico 's legislature , governor , and other public authorities . Political status The latest referendum on statehood , independence , or an associated republic was held on November 6 , 2012 . The people of Puerto Rico made history by requesting , for the first time ever , the conclusion of the island 's current territorial status . Almost 78 % of registered voters participated in a plebiscite held to resolve Puerto Rico 's status , and a slim but clear majority ( 54 % ) disagreed with Puerto Rico maintaining its present territorial status . Furthermore , among the possible alternatives , sixty - one percent ( 61 % ) of voters chose the statehood option , while one third of the ballots were submitted blank . On December 11 , 2012 , the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico enacted a concurrent resolution requesting the President and the Congress of the United States to respond to the referendum of the people of Puerto Rico , held on November 6 , 2012 , to end its current form of territorial status and to begin the process to admit Puerto Rico as a State . The initiative has not made Puerto Rico into a state . Hurricane Maria In late September 2017 , Hurricane Maria hit the island as a Category 4 storm causing severe damage to homes , other buildings and infrastructure . The recovery as of late November was slow but progress had been made . Electricity was restored to two - thirds of the island , although there was some doubt as to the number of residents getting reliable power . In January 2018 , it was reported that close to 40 percent of the island 's customers still did not have electricity . The vast majority had access to water but were still required to boil it . The number still living in shelters had dropped to 982 with thousands of others living with relatives . The official death toll at the time was 58 but some sources indicated that the actual number is much higher . A dam on the island was close to failure and officials were concerned about additional flooding from this source . Thousands had left Puerto Rico , with close to 200,000 having arrived in Florida alone . Those who were then living on the mainland experienced difficulty in getting health care benefits . A New York Times report on November 27 said it was understandable that Puerto Ricans wanted to leave the island . `` Basic essentials are hard to find and electricity and other utilities are unreliable or entirely inaccessible . Much of the population has been unable to return to jobs or to school and access to health care has been severely limited . '' The Center for Puerto Rican Studies at New York 's Hunter College estimated that some half million people , about 14 % of the population , may permanently leave by 2019 . The total damage on the island was estimated as up to $95 billion . By the end of November , FEMA had received over a million applications for aid and had approved about a quarter of those . The US government had agreed in October to provide funding to rebuild and up to $4.9 billion in loans to help the island 's government . FEMA had $464 million earmarked to help local governments rebuild public buildings and infrastructure . Bills for other funding were being considered in Washington but little progress had been made on those . A November 28 , 2017 report by the Sierra Club included this comment : `` It will take years to rebuild Puerto Rico , not just from the worst hurricane to make landfall since 1932 , but to sustainably overcome environmental injustices which made Maria 's devastation even more catastrophic '' . In May , 2017 , the Natural Resources Defense Council reported that Puerto Rico 's water system was the worst as measured by the Clean Water Act . 70 % of the population drank water that violated U.S. law . Geography Main articles : Geography of Puerto Rico and Geology of Puerto Rico A map of Puerto Rico Puerto Rico consists of the main island of Puerto Rico and various smaller islands , including Vieques , Culebra , Mona , Desecheo , and Caja de Muertos . Of these five , only Culebra and Vieques are inhabited year - round . Mona , which has played a key role in maritime history , is uninhabited most of the year except for employees of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources . There are many other even smaller islets , like Monito , which is near to Mona , Isla de Cabras and La Isleta de San Juan , both located on the San Juan Bay . The latter is the only inhabited islet with communities like Old San Juan and Puerta de Tierra , and connected to the main island by bridges . The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has an area of 13,790 square kilometers ( 5,320 sq mi ) , of which 8,870 km ( 3,420 sq mi ) is land and 4,921 km ( 1,900 sq mi ) is water . Puerto Rico is larger than two U.S. states , Delaware and Rhode Island . The maximum length of the main island from east to west is 180 km ( 110 mi ) , and the maximum width from north to south is 65 km ( 40 mi ) . Puerto Rico is the smallest of the Greater Antilles . It is 80 % of the size of Jamaica , just over 18 % of the size of Hispaniola and 8 % of the size of Cuba , the largest of the Greater Antilles . The island is mostly mountainous with large coastal areas in the north and south . The main mountain range is called `` La Cordillera Central '' ( The Central Range ) . The highest elevation in Puerto Rico , Cerro de Punta 1,338 meters ( 4,390 ft ) , is located in this range . Another important peak is El Yunque , one of the highest in the Sierra de Luquillo at the El Yunque National Forest , with an elevation of 1,065 m ( 3,494 ft ) . The coast at Patillas , Puerto Rico Puerto Rico has 17 lakes , all man - made , and more than 50 rivers , most originating in the Cordillera Central . Rivers in the northern region of the island are typically longer and of higher water flow rates than those of the south , since the south receives less rain than the central and northern regions . Puerto Rico is composed of Cretaceous to Eocene volcanic and plutonic rocks , overlain by younger Oligocene and more recent carbonates and other sedimentary rocks . Most of the caverns and karst topography on the island occurs in the northern region in the carbonates . The oldest rocks are approximately 190 million years old ( Jurassic ) and are located at Sierra Bermeja in the southwest part of the island . They may represent part of the oceanic crust and are believed to come from the Pacific Ocean realm . Puerto Rico lies at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American plates and is being deformed by the tectonic stresses caused by their interaction . These stresses may cause earthquakes and tsunamis . These seismic events , along with landslides , represent some of the most dangerous geologic hazards in the island and in the northeastern Caribbean . The most recent major earthquake occurred on October 11 , 1918 , and had an estimated magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale . It originated off the coast of Aguadilla , several kilometers off the northern coast , and was accompanied by a tsunami . It caused extensive property damage and widespread losses , damaging infrastructure , especially bridges . It resulted in an estimated 116 deaths and $4 million in property damage . The failure of the government to move rapidly to provide for the general welfare contributed to political activism by opponents and eventually to the rise of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party . The Puerto Rico Trench , the largest and deepest trench in the Atlantic , is located about 115 km ( 71 mi ) north of Puerto Rico at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American plates . It is 280 km ( 170 mi ) long . At its deepest point , named the Milwaukee Deep , it is almost 8,400 m ( 27,600 ft ) deep . Climate Puerto Rico seen from space ( STS - 34 mission ) Main article : Climate of Puerto Rico The climate of Puerto Rico in the Köppen climate classification is tropical rainforest . Temperatures are warm to hot year round , averaging near 85 ° F ( 29 ° C ) in lower elevations and 70 ° F ( 21 ° C ) in the mountains . Easterly trade winds pass across the island year round . Puerto Rico has a rainy season which stretches from April into November . The mountains of the Cordillera Central are the main cause of the variations in the temperature and rainfall that occur over very short distances . The mountains can also cause wide variation in local wind speed and direction due to their sheltering and channeling effects adding to the climatic variation . The island has an average temperature of 82.4 ° F ( 28 ° C ) throughout the year , with an average minimum temperature of 66.9 ° F ( 19 ° C ) and maximum of 85.4 ° F ( 30 ° C ) . Daily temperature changes seasonally are quite small in the lowlands and coastal areas . The temperature in the south is usually a few degrees higher than the north and temperatures in the central interior mountains are always cooler than those on the rest of the island . Between the dry and wet season , there is a temperature change of around 6 ° F ( 3.3 ° C ) . This is mainly due to the warm waters of the tropical Atlantic Ocean , which significantly modify cooler air moving in from the north and northwest . Coastal waters temperatures around the years are about 75 ° F ( 24 ° C ) in February to 85 ° F ( 29 ° C ) in August . The highest temperature ever recorded was 99 ° F ( 37 ° C ) at Arecibo , while the lowest temperature ever recorded was 40 ° F ( 4 ° C ) in the mountains at Adjuntas , Aibonito , and Corozal . The average yearly precipitation is 1,687 mm ( 66 in ) .

The Weather Channel . Retrieved March 22 , 2014 . Puerto Rico experiences the Atlantic hurricane season , similar to the remainder of the Caribbean Sea and North Atlantic oceans . On average , a quarter of its annual rainfall is contributed from tropical cyclones , which are more prevalent during periods of La Niña than El Niño . A cyclone of tropical storm strength passes near Puerto Rico , on average , every five years . A hurricane passes in the vicinity of the island , on average , every seven years . Since 1851 , the Lake Okeechobee Hurricane of September 1928 is the only hurricane to make landfall as a Category 5 hurricane . In the busy 2017 Atlantic hurricane season , Puerto Rico avoided a direct hit by the Category 5 Hurricane Irma on September 8 , 2017 , but high winds caused a loss of electrical power to some one million residents . Almost 50 % of hospitals were operating with power provided by generators . The Category 4 Hurricane Jose , as expected , veered away from Puerto Rico . A short time later , the devastating Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane , with sustained 155 mph ( 249 km / h ) winds , powerful rains and widespread flooding causing tremendous destruction , including the electrical grid , which could remain out for 4 -- 6 months . With such widespread destruction and a great need for supplies -- everything from drinking water , food , medicine and personal care items to fuel for generators and construction materials for rebuilding the island -- Gov. Rossello and several Congressmen called on the federal government to waive the WWI - era Jones Act ( protectionist provisions : ships made and owned in U.S. , and with U.S. crews ) , which essentially double Puerto Rico 's cost for shipped goods relative to neighboring islands . On September 28 , U.S. President Donald Trump waived the Act for ten days . Biodiversity Main articles : Fauna of Puerto Rico and Flora of Puerto Rico Common Coquí Species endemic to the archipelago number 239 plants , 16 birds and 39 amphibians / reptiles , recognized as of 1998 . Most of these ( 234 , 12 and 33 respectively ) are found on the main island . The most recognizable endemic species and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride is the coquí , a small frog easily identified by the sound of its call , from which it gets its name . Most coquí species ( 13 of 17 ) live in the El Yunque National Forest , a tropical rainforest in the northeast of the island previously known as the Caribbean National Forest . El Yunque is home to more than 240 plants , 26 of which are endemic to the island . It is also home to 50 bird species , including the critically endangered Puerto Rican amazon . Across the island in the southwest , the 40 km ( 15 sq mi ) of dry land at the Guánica Commonwealth Forest Reserve contain over 600 uncommon species of plants and animals , including 48 endangered species and 16 endemic to Puerto Rico .

From 2000 to 2010 , the population decreased , the first such decrease in census history for Puerto Rico . It went from the 3,808,610 residents registered in the 2000 Census to 3,725,789 in the 2010 Census . A declining and aging population presents additional problems for the society . The U.S. Census Bureau 's estimate for July 1 , 2016 was 3,411,307 people , down substantially from the 2010 data which had indicated 3,725,789 people . Continuous European immigration and high natural increase helped the population of Puerto Rico grow from 155,426 in 1800 , to almost a million by the close of the 19th century . A census conducted by royal decree on September 30 , 1858 , gave the following totals of the Puerto Rican population at that time : 341,015 were Free colored ; 300,430 identified as Whites ; and 41,736 were slaves . During the 19th century hundreds of families arrived in Puerto Rico , primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia , but also from other parts of Spain such as Catalonia , Asturias , Galicia and the Balearic Islands and numerous Spanish loyalists from Spain 's former colonies in South America . Settlers from outside Spain also arrived in the islands , including from Corsica , France , Lebanon , China , Portugal , Ireland , Scotland , Germany and Italy . This immigration from non-Hispanic countries was the result of the Real Cedula de Gracias de 1815 ( `` Royal Decree of Graces of 1815 '' ) , which allowed European Catholics to settle in the island with land allotments in the interior of the island , provided they paid taxes and continued to support the Catholic Church . Racial and Ethnic Composition in Puerto Rico ( 2015 Census est . ) Ethnicity White 75.8 % Black or African American 12.4 % Asian 0.2 % Two or more races 3.3 % American Indian 0.5 % Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander 0.1 % Other races 7.8 % Between 1960 and 1990 the census questionnaire in Puerto Rico did not ask about race or ethnicity . The 2000 United States Census included a racial self - identification question in Puerto Rico . According to the census , most Puerto Ricans identified as White and Hispanic ; few identified as Black or some other race . Population genetics A recent population genetics study conducted in Puerto Rico suggests that between 52.6 % and 84 % of the population possess some degree of Amerindian mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) in their maternal ancestry , usually in a combination with other ancestries such as aboriginal Guanche North - West African ancestry brought by Spanish settlers from the Canary Islands . In addition , these DNA studies show Amerindian ancestry in addition to the Taíno . One genetic study on the racial makeup of Puerto Ricans ( including all races ) found them to be roughly around 61 % West Eurasian / North African ( overwhelmingly of Spanish provenance ) , 27 % Sub-Saharan African and 11 % Native American . Another genetic study from 2007 , claimed that `` the average genomewide individual ( ie . Puerto Rican ) ancestry proportions have been estimated as 66 % , 18 % , and 16 % , for European , West African , and Native American , respectively . '' Other study estimates 63.7 % European , 21.2 % ( Sub-Saharan ) African , and 15.2 % Native American ; European ancestry is more prevalent in the West and in Central Puerto Rico , African in Eastern Puerto Rico , and Native American in Northern Puerto Rico . A Pew Research survey indicated a literacy rate of 90.4 % ( adult population ) in 2012 based on data from the United Nations and a life expectancy of 79.3 years . Immigration and emigration Racial groups Year Population White Mixed ( mainly biracial white European and black African ) Black Asian Other 2000 3,808,610 80.5 % ( 3 064 862 ) 11.0 % ( 418 426 ) 8.0 % ( 302 933 ) 0.2 % ( 7 960 ) 0.4 % ( 14 429 ) 3,725,789 75.8 % ( ' 2 824 148 ) 11.1 % ( ' 413 563 ) 12.4 % ( ' 461 998 ) 0.2 % ( ' 7 452 ) 0.6 % ( ' 22 355 ) Puerto Rico has recently become the permanent home of over 100,000 legal residents . The vast majority of recent immigrants , both legal and illegal , come from the Dominican Republic and Haiti . Other sources sending in significant numbers of recent immigrants include Cuba , Mexico , Colombia , Panama , Jamaica , Venezuela , Spain , and Nigeria . Also , there are many non-Puerto Rican U.S. citizens settling in Puerto Rico , from the mainland United States and the U.S. Virgin Islands , as well as Nuyoricans ( stateside Puerto Ricans ) coming back to Puerto Rico . Most recent immigrants settle in and around San Juan . Emigration is a major part of contemporary Puerto Rican history . Starting soon after World War II , poverty , cheap airfares , and promotion by the island government caused waves of Puerto Ricans to move to the United States , particularly to the Northeastern states , and Florida . This trend continued even as Puerto Rico 's economy improved and its birth rate declined . Puerto Ricans continue to follow a pattern of `` circular migration '' , with some migrants returning to the island . In recent years , the population has declined markedly , falling nearly 1 % in 2012 and an additional 1 % ( 36,000 people ) in 2013 due to a falling birthrate and emigration . According to the 2010 Census , the number of Puerto Ricans living in the United States outside of Puerto Rico far exceeds those living in Puerto Rico . Emigration exceeds immigration . As those who leave tend to be better educated than those that remain , this accentuates the drain on Puerto Rico 's economy . Based on the July 1 , 2016 estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau , the population of the Commonwealth had declined by 314,482 people since the 2010 Census data had been tabulated . Population distribution The most populous city is the capital , San Juan , with approximately 371,400 people based on a 2015 estimate by the Census Bureau . Other major cities include Bayamón , Carolina , Ponce , and Caguas . Of the ten most populous cities on the island , eight are located within what is considered San Juan 's metropolitan area , while the other two are located in the south ( Ponce ) and west ( Mayagüez ) of the island .

Spanish is , and has been , the only official language of the entire Commonwealth judiciary system , despite a 1902 English - only language law . However , all official business of the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico is conducted in English . English is the primary language of less than 10 % of the population . Spanish is the dominant language of business , education and daily life on the island , spoken by nearly 95 % of the population . The U.S. Census Bureau 's 2015 update provides the following facts : 94.1 % of adults speak Spanish , 5.8 % speak only English , 78.3 % do not speak English `` very well '' . In Puerto Rico , public school instruction is conducted almost entirely in Spanish . There have been pilot programs in about a dozen of the over 1,400 public schools aimed at conducting instruction in English only . Objections from teaching staff are common , perhaps because many of them are not fully fluent in English . English is taught as a second language and is a compulsory subject from elementary levels to high school . The languages of the deaf community are American Sign Language and its local variant , Puerto Rican Sign Language . The Spanish of Puerto Rico has evolved into having many idiosyncrasies in vocabulary and syntax that differentiate it from the Spanish spoken elsewhere . As a product of Puerto Rican history , the island possesses a unique Spanish dialect . Puerto Rican Spanish utilizes many Taíno words , as well as English words . The largest influence on the Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico is that of the Canary Islands . The Spanish of Puerto Rico also includes Taíno words , typically in the context of vegetation , natural phenomena or primitive musical instruments . Similarly , words attributed to primarily West African languages were adopted in the contexts of foods , music or dances , particularly in coastal towns with concentrations of descendants of Sub-Saharan Africans . Religion Religious affiliation in Puerto Rico ( 2014 ) Roman Catholic ( 56 % ) Protestant ( 33 % ) Other ( 3 % ) Irreligious ( 8 % ) The Roman Catholic Church was brought by Spanish colonists and gradually became the dominant religion in Puerto Rico . The first dioceses in the Americas , including that of Puerto Rico , were authorized by Pope Julius II in 1511 . One Pope , John Paul II , visited Puerto Rico in October 1984 . All municipalities in Puerto Rico have at least one Catholic church , most of which are located at the town center , or plaza . African slaves brought and maintained various ethnic African religious practices associated with different peoples ; in particular , the Yoruba beliefs of Santería and / or Ifá , and the Kongo - derived Palo Mayombe . Some aspects were absorbed into syncretic Christianity . Protestantism , which was suppressed under the Spanish Catholic regime , has slightly reemerged under United States rule , making contemporary Puerto Rico more interconfessional than in previous centuries , although Catholicism continues to be the dominant religion . The first Protestant church , Iglesia de la Santísima Trinidad , was established in Ponce by the Anglican Diocese of Antigua in 1872 . It was the first non-Roman Catholic Church in the entire Spanish Empire in the Americas . Pollster Pablo Ramos stated in 1998 that the population was 38 % Roman Catholic , 28 % Pentecostal , and 18 % were members of independent churches , which would give a Protestant percentage of 46 % if the last two populations are combined . Protestants collectively added up to almost two million people . Another researcher gave a more conservative assessment of the proportion of Protestants : Puerto Rico , by virtue of its long political association with the United States , is the most Protestant of Latin American countries , with a Protestant population of approximately 33 to 38 percent , the majority of whom are Pentecostal . David Stoll calculates that if we extrapolate the growth rates of evangelical churches from 1960 -- 1985 for another twenty - five years Puerto Rico will become 75 percent evangelical . ( Ana Adams : `` Brincando el Charco ... '' in Power , Politics and Pentecostals in Latin America , Edward Cleary , ed. , 1997 . p. 164 ) . The data provided for 2014 by Pew Research Center , is summarized in the chart to the right . An Associated Press article in March 2014 stated that `` more than 70 percent of whom identify themselves as Catholic '' but provided no source for this information . The CIA World Factbook reports that 85 % of the population of Puerto Rico identifies as Roman Catholic , while 15 % identify as Protestant and Other . Neither a date or a source for that information is provided and may not be recent . A 2013 Pew Research survey found that only about 45 % of Puerto Rican adults identified themselves as Catholic , 29 % as Protestant and 20 % as unaffiliated with a religion . The people surveyed by Pew consisted of Puerto Ricans living in the 50 states and DC and may not be indicative of those living in the Commonwealth . By 2014 , a Pew Research report , with the sub-title Widespread Change in a Historically Catholic Region , indicated that only 56 % of Puerto Ricans were Catholic and that 33 % were Protestant ; this survey was completed between October 2013 and February 2014 . An Eastern Orthodox community , the Dormition of the Most Holy Theotokos / St. Spyridon 's Church is located in Trujillo Alto , and serves the small Orthodox community . This affiliation accounted for under 1 % of the population in 2010 according to the Pew Research report . In 1940 , Juanita García Peraza founded the Mita Congregation , the first religion of Puerto Rican origin . Taíno religious practices have been rediscovered / reinvented to a degree by a handful of advocates . Similarly , some aspects of African religious traditions have been kept by some adherents . In 1952 , a handful of American Jews established the island 's first synagogue ; this religion accounts for under 1 % of the population in 2010 according to the Pew Research report . The synagogue , called Sha'are Zedeck , hired its first rabbi in 1954 . Puerto Rico has the largest Jewish community in the Caribbean , numbering 3000 people ( date not stated ) , and is the only Caribbean island in which the Conservative , Reform and Orthodox Jewish movements all are represented . In 2007 , there were about 5,000 Muslims in Puerto Rico , representing about 0.13 % of the population . Eight mosques are located throughout the island , with most Muslims living in Río Piedras and Caguas , most of these Muslims are of Palestinian and Jordanian descent . In 2015 , the 25,832 Jehovah 's Witnesses represented about 0.70 % of the population , with 324 congregations . The Padmasambhava Buddhist Center , whose followers practice Tibetan Buddhism , has a branch in Puerto Rico . Roman Catholic Cathedral of San Juan Bautista . Anglican Iglesia Santísima Trinidad in Ponce Islamic Center at Ponce Inside Sha'are Zedeck in San Juan Government Main articles : Government of Puerto Rico and Politics of Puerto Rico Puerto Rico has 8 senatorial districts , 40 representative districts and 78 municipalities . It has a republican form of government with separation of powers subject to the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United States . Its current powers are all delegated by the United States Congress and lack full protection under the United States Constitution . Puerto Rico 's head of state is the President of the United States . The government of Puerto Rico , based on the formal republican system , is composed of three branches : the executive , legislative , and judicial branch . The executive branch is headed by the governor , currently Ricky Rosselló . The legislative branch consists of a bicameral legislature called the Legislative Assembly , made up of a Senate as its upper chamber and a House of Representatives as its lower chamber . The Senate is headed by the President of the Senate , currently Thomas Rivera Schatz , while the House of Representatives is headed by the Speaker of the House , currently Johnny Méndez . The governor and legislators are elected by popular vote every four years with the last election held in November 2016 . The judicial branch is headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico , currently Maite Oronoz Rodríguez . Members of the judicial branch are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate . Puerto Rico is represented in the United States Congress by a nonvoting delegate , the Resident Commissioner , currently Jenniffer González . Current congressional rules have removed the Commissioner 's power to vote in the Committee of the Whole , but the Commissioner can vote in committee . Puerto Rican elections are governed by the Federal Election Commission and the State Elections Commission of Puerto Rico . While residing in Puerto Rico , Puerto Ricans can not vote in U.S. presidential elections , but they can vote in primaries . Puerto Ricans who become residents of a U.S. state can vote in presidential elections . Puerto Rico hosts consulates from 41 countries , mainly from the Americas and Europe , with most located in San Juan . As an unincorporated territory of the United States , Puerto Rico does not have any first - order administrative divisions as defined by the U.S. government , but has 78 municipalities at the second level . Mona Island is not a municipality , but part of the municipality of Mayagüez . Municipalities are subdivided into wards or barrios , and those into sectors . Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected for a four - year term . The municipality of San Juan ( previously called `` town '' ) , was founded first , in 1521 , San Germán in 1570 , Coamo in 1579 , Arecibo in 1614 , Aguada in 1692 and Ponce in 1692 . An increase of settlement saw the founding of 30 municipalities in the 18th century and 34 in the 19th . Six were founded in the 20th century ; the last was Florida in 1971 . Political parties and elections Main article : Political party strength in Puerto Rico The difference between the incumbent party , the PPD , and its opponent , the PNP , was a mere 0.6 % in the last election . This difference is common as the political landscape experiences political cycles between both parties , with the PPD ruling all branches of government for 36 of the past 64 years . The PNP , on the other hand , has ruled both the executive and legislative branch concurrently for 16 years . The other 12 years experienced a divided government . Since 1952 , Puerto Rico has had three main political parties : the Popular Democratic Party ( PPD in Spanish ) , the New Progressive Party ( PNP in Spanish ) and the Puerto Rican Independence Party ( PIP ) . The three parties stand for different political status . The PPD , for example , seeks to maintain the island 's status with the U.S. as a commonwealth , while the PNP , on the other hand , seeks to make Puerto Rico a state of the United States . The PIP , in contrast , seeks a complete separation from the United States by seeking to make Puerto Rico a sovereign nation . In terms of party strength , the PPD and PNP usually hold about 47 % of the vote each while the PIP holds only about 5 % . After 2007 , other parties emerged on the island . The first , the Puerto Ricans for Puerto Rico Party ( PPR in Spanish ) was registered that same year . The party claims that it seeks to address the islands ' problems from a status - neutral platform . But it ceased to remain as a registered party when it failed to obtain the required number of votes in the 2008 general election . Four years later , the 2012 election saw the emergence of the Movimiento Unión Soberanista ( MUS ; English : Sovereign Union Movement ) and the Partido del Pueblo Trabajador ( PPT ; English : Working People 's Party ) but none obtained more than 1 % of the vote . Other non-registered parties include the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party , the Socialist Workers Movement , and the Hostosian National Independence Movement . Law Main articles : Constitution of Puerto Rico and Law of Puerto Rico The insular legal system is a blend of civil law and the common law systems . Puerto Rico is the only current U.S. possession whose legal system operates primarily in a language other than American English : namely , Spanish . Because the U.S. federal government operates primarily in English , all Puerto Rican attorneys must be bilingual in order to litigate in English in U.S. federal courts , and litigate federal preemption issues in Puerto Rican courts . Title 48 of the United States Code outlines the role of the United States Code to United States territories and insular areas such as Puerto Rico . After the U.S. government assumed control of Puerto Rico in 1901 , it initiated legal reforms resulting in the adoption of codes of criminal law , criminal procedure , and civil procedure modeled after those then in effect in California . Although Puerto Rico has since followed the federal example of transferring criminal and civil procedure from statutory law to rules promulgated by the judiciary , several portions of its criminal law still reflect the influence of the California Penal Code . The judicial branch is headed by the Chief Justice of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court , which is the only appellate court required by the Constitution . All other courts are created by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico . There is also a Federal District Court for Puerto Rico . Someone accused of a criminal act at the federal level may not be accused for the same act in a Commonwealth court , unlike a state court , since Puerto Rico as a territory lacks sovereignty separate from Congress as a state does . Such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy . Political status Main articles : Political status of Puerto Rico and Proposed political status for Puerto Rico The nature of Puerto Rico 's political relationship with the U.S. is the subject of ongoing debate in Puerto Rico , the United States Congress , and the United Nations . Specifically , the basic question is whether Puerto Rico should remain a U.S. territory , become a U.S. state , or become an independent country . Within the United States The Capitol of Puerto Rico , home of the Legislative Assembly in Puerto Rico Constitutionally , Puerto Rico is subject to the plenary powers of the United States Congress under the territorial clause of Article IV of the U.S. Constitution . Laws enacted at the federal level in the United States apply to Puerto Rico as well , regardless of its political status . Their residents do not have voting representation in the U.S. Congress . Like the different states of the United States , Puerto Rico lacks `` the full sovereignty of an independent nation '' , for example , the power to manage its `` external relations with other nations '' , which is held by the U.S. federal government . The Supreme Court of the United States has indicated that once the U.S. Constitution has been extended to an area ( by Congress or the courts ) , its coverage is irrevocable . To hold that the political branches may switch the Constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they , not this Court , say `` what the law is '' . Puerto Ricans `` were collectively made U.S. citizens '' in 1917 as a result of the Jones - Shafroth Act . U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico can not vote for the U.S. president , though both major parties , Republican and Democratic , run primary elections in Puerto Rico to send delegates to vote on a presidential candidate . Since Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory ( see above ) and not a U.S. state , the United States Constitution does not fully enfranchise U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico . Only fundamental rights under the American federal constitution and adjudications are applied to Puerto Ricans . Various other U.S. Supreme Court decisions have held which rights apply in Puerto Rico and which ones do not . Puerto Ricans have a long history of service in the U.S. Armed Forces and , since 1917 , they have been included in the U.S. compulsory draft whensoever it has been in effect . Though the Commonwealth government has its own tax laws , Puerto Ricans are also required to pay many kinds of U.S. federal taxes , not including the federal personal income tax for Puerto Rico - sourced income , but only under certain circumstances . In 2009 , Puerto Rico paid $3.742 billion into the U.S. Treasury . Residents of Puerto Rico pay into Social Security , and are thus eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement . They are excluded from the Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) , and the island actually receives a smaller fraction of the Medicaid funding it would receive if it were a U.S. state . Also , Medicare providers receive less - than - full state - like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in Puerto Rico , even though the latter paid fully into the system . While a state may try an individual for the same crime he / she was tried in federal court , this is not the case in Puerto Rico . Being a U.S. territory , Puerto Rico 's authority to enact a criminal code derives from Congress and not from local sovereignty as with the states . Thus , such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy and is constitutionally impermissible . In 1992 , President George H.W. Bush issued a memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies establishing the current administrative relationship between the federal government and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico . This memorandum directs all federal departments , agencies , and officials to treat Puerto Rico administratively as if it were a state , insofar as doing so would not disrupt federal programs or operations . Many federal executive branch agencies have significant presence in Puerto Rico , just as in any state , including the Federal Bureau of Investigation , Federal Emergency Management Agency , Transportation Security Administration , Social Security Administration , and others . While Puerto Rico has its own Commonwealth judicial system similar to that of a U.S. state , there is also a U.S. federal district court in Puerto Rico , and Puerto Ricans have served as judges in that Court and in other federal courts on the U.S. mainland regardless of their residency status at the time of their appointment . Sonia Sotomayor , a New Yorker of Puerto Rican descent , serves as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States . Puerto Ricans have also been frequently appointed to high - level federal positions , including serving as United States Ambassadors to other nations .

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( November 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Main article : Foreign and intergovernmental relations of Puerto Rico Puerto Rico is subject to the Commerce and Territorial Clause of the Constitution of the United States and , therefore , is restricted on how it can engage with other nations , sharing the opportunities and limitations that state governments have albeit not being one . As is the case with state governments , regardless , it has established several trade agreements with other nations , particularly with Hispanic American countries such as Colombia and Panamá . It has also established trade promotion offices in many foreign countries , all Spanish - speaking , and within the United States itself , which now include Spain , the Dominican Republic , Panama , Colombia , Washington , D.C. , New York City and Florida , and has included in the past offices in Chile , Costa Rica , and Mexico . Such agreements require permission from the U.S. Department of State ; most , are simply allowed by existing laws or trade treaties between the United States and other nations which supersede trade agreements pursued by Puerto Rico and different U.S. states . At the local level , Puerto Rico established by law that the international relations which states and territories are allowed to engage must be handled by the Department of State of Puerto Rico , an executive department , headed by the Secretary of State of Puerto Rico , who also serves as the territory 's lieutenant governor . It is also charged to liaise with general consuls and honorary consuls based in Puerto Rico . The Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration , along with the Office of the Resident Commissioner , manage all its intergovernmental affairs before entities of or in the United States ( including the federal government of the United States , local and state governments of the United States , and public or private entities in the United States ) . Both entities frequently assist the Department of State of Puerto Rico in engaging with Washington , D.C. - based ambassadors and federal agencies that handle Puerto Rico 's foreign affairs , such as the U.S. Department of State , the Agency for International Development , and others . The current Secretary of State is Víctor Suárez Meléndez from the Popular Democratic Party and member of the Democratic Party of the United States , while the current Director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration is Juan Eugenio Hernández Mayoral also from the Popular Democratic and member of the Democratic Party . The Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico , the delegate elected by Puerto Ricans to represent them before the federal government , including the U.S. Congress , sits in the United States House of Representatives , serves and votes on congressional committees , and functions in every respect as a legislator except being denied a vote on the final disposition of legislation on the House floor , also engages in foreign affairs to the same extent as other members of Congress . The current Resident Commissioner is Pedro Pierluisi from the New Progressive Party and member of the Democratic Party of the United States . Many Puerto Ricans have served as United States ambassadors to different nations and international organizations , such as the Organization of American States , mostly but not exclusively in Latin America . For example , Maricarmen Aponte , a Puerto Rican and now an Acting Assistant Secretary of State , previously served as U.S. ambassador to El Salvador . Military Main article : Military of Puerto Rico As it is a territory of the United States of America , the defense of Puerto Rico is provided by the United States as part of the Treaty of Paris with the President of the United States as its commander - in - chief . Puerto Rico has its own Puerto Rico National Guard , and its own state defense force , the Puerto Rico State Guard , which by local law is under the authority of the Puerto Rico National Guard . The commander - in - chief of both local forces is the governor of Puerto Rico who delegates his authority to the Puerto Rico Adjutant General , currently Brigadier General Isabelo Rivera . The Adjutant General , in turn , delegates the authority over the State Guard to another officer but retains the authority over the Puerto Rico National Guard as a whole . U.S. military installations in Puerto Rico ( including the United States Virgin Islands ) throughout the 20th century U.S. military installations in Puerto Rico were part of the U.S. Atlantic Command ( LANTCOM after 1993 USACOM ) , which had authority over all U.S. military operations that took place throughout the Atlantic . Puerto Rico had been seen as crucial in supporting LANTCOM 's mission until 1999 , when U.S. Atlantic Command was renamed and given a new mission as United States Joint Forces Command . Puerto Rico is currently under the responsibility of United States Northern Command . Both the Naval Forces Caribbean ( NFC ) and the Fleet Air Caribbean ( FAIR ) were formerly based at the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station . The NFC had authority over all U.S. Naval activity in the waters of the Caribbean while FAIR had authority over all U.S. military flights and air operations over the Caribbean . With the closing of the Roosevelt Roads and Vieques Island training facilities , the U.S. Navy has basically exited from Puerto Rico , except for the ships that steam by , and the only significant military presence in the island is the U.S. Army at Ft Buchanan , the Puerto Rican Army and Air National Guards , and the U.S. Coast Guard . Protests over the noise of bombing practice forced the closure of the naval base . This resulted in a loss of 6,000 jobs and an annual decrease in local income of $300 million . A branch of the U.S. Army National Guard is stationed in Puerto Rico -- known as the Puerto Rico Army National Guard -- which performs missions equivalent to those of the Army National Guards of the different states of the United States , including ground defense , disaster relief , and control of civil unrest . The local National Guard also incorporates a branch of the U.S. Air National Guard -- known as the Puerto Rico Air National Guard -- which performs missions equivalent to those of the Air National Guards of each one of the U.S. states . Ohio - class ballistic missile submarine USS Maryland , Roosevelt Roads Naval Station , 1997 At different times in the 20th century , the U.S. had about 25 military or naval installations in Puerto Rico , some very small ones , as well as large installations . The largest of these installations were the former Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Ceiba , the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility ( AFWTF ) on Vieques , the National Guard training facility at Camp Santiago in Salinas , Fort Allen in Juana Diaz , the Army 's Fort Buchanan in San Juan , the former U.S. Air Force Ramey Air Force Base in Aguadilla , and the Puerto Rico Air National Guard at Muñiz Air Force base in San Juan . The former U.S. Navy facilities at Roosevelt Roads , Vieques , and Sabana Seca have been deactivated and partially turned over to the local government . Other than U.S. Coast Guard and Puerto Rico National Guard facilities , there are only two remaining military installations in Puerto Rico : the U.S. Army 's small Ft. Buchanan ( supporting local veterans and reserve units ) and the PRANG ( Puerto Rico Air National Guard ) Muñiz Air Base ( the C - 130 Fleet ) . In recent years , the U.S. Congress has considered their deactivations , but these have been opposed by diverse public and private entities in Puerto Rico -- such as retired military who rely on Ft. Buchanan for the services available there . Puerto Ricans have participated in many of the military conflicts in which the United States has been involved . For example , they participated in the American Revolution , when volunteers from Puerto Rico , Cuba , and Mexico fought the British in 1779 under the command of General Bernardo de Gálvez ( 1746 -- 1786 ) , and have continued to participate up to the present - day conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan . A significant number of Puerto Ricans participate as members and work for the U.S. Armed Services , largely as National Guard members and civilian employees . The size of the overall military - related community in Puerto Rico is estimated to be 100,000 individuals . This includes retired personnel . Fort Buchanan has about 4,000 military and civilian personnel . In addition , approximately 17,000 people are members of the Puerto Rico Army and Air National Guards , or the U.S. Reserve forces . Puerto Rican soldiers have served in every U.S. military conflict from World War I to the current military engagement known by the United States and its allies as the War against Terrorism . The 65th Infantry Regiment , nicknamed `` The Borinqueneers '' from the original Taíno name of the island ( Borinquen ) , is a Puerto Rican regiment of the United States Army . The regiment 's motto is Honor et Fidelitas , Latin for Honor and Fidelity . The 65th Infantry Regiment participated in World War I , World War II , the Korean War , and the War on Terror and in 2014 was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal , presented by President Barack Obama , for its heroism during the Korean War . Administrative divisions Main article : Municipalities of Puerto Rico There are no counties , as there are in 48 of the 50 United States . There are 78 municipalities . Municipalities are subdivided into barrios , and those into sectors . Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected to four - year terms . A map of Puerto Rico showing its municipalities Economy Main articles : Economy of Puerto Rico and Puerto Rico government - debt crisis Puerto Rico 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) by economic sector The economy of Puerto Rico is classified as a high income economy by the World Bank and as the most competitive economy in Latin America by the World Economic Forum but Puerto Rico currently has a public debt of $72.204 billion ( equivalent to 103 % of GNP ) , and a government deficit of $2.5 billion . According to World Bank , gross national income per capita of Puerto Rico in 2013 is $23,830 ( PPP , International Dollars ) , ranked as 63rd among all sovereign and dependent territories entities in the world . Its economy is mainly driven by manufacturing ( primarily pharmaceuticals , textiles , petrochemicals and electronics ) followed by the service industry ( primarily finance , insurance , real estate and tourism ) . In recent years , the territory has also become a popular destination for MICE ( meetings , incentives , conferencing , exhibitions ) , with a modern convention centre district overlooking the Port of San Juan . The geography of Puerto Rico and its political status are both determining factors on its economic prosperity , primarily due to its relatively small size as an island ; its lack of natural resources used to produce raw materials , and , consequently , its dependence on imports ; as well as its territorial status with the United States , which controls its foreign policy while exerting trading restrictions , particularly in its shipping industry . Puerto Rico experienced a recession from 2006 to 2011 , interrupted by 4 quarters of economic growth , and entered into recession again in 2013 , following growing fiscal imbalance and the expiration of the IRS Section 936 corporate incentives that the U.S. Internal Revenue Code had applied to Puerto Rico . This IRS section was critical to the economy , as it established tax exemptions for U.S. corporations that settled in Puerto Rico , and allowed their insular subsidiaries to send their earnings to the parent corporation at any time , without paying federal tax on corporate income . Puerto Rico has surprisingly been able to maintain a relatively low inflation in the past decade while maintaining a purchasing power parity per capita higher than 80 % of the rest of the world . Academically , most of Puerto Rico 's economic woes stem from federal regulations that expired , have been repealed , or no longer apply to Puerto Rico ; its inability to become self - sufficient and self - sustainable throughout history ; its highly politicized public policy which tends to change whenever a political party gains power ; as well as its highly inefficient local government which has accrued a public debt equal to 68 % of its gross domestic product throughout time . In comparison to the different states of the United States , Puerto Rico is poorer than Mississippi ( the poorest state of the U.S. ) with 41 % of its population below the poverty line . When compared to Latin America , Puerto Rico has the highest GDP per capita in the region . Its main trading partners are the United States itself , Ireland , and Japan , with most products coming from East Asia , mainly from China , Hong Kong , and Taiwan . At a global scale , Puerto Rico 's dependency on oil for transportation and electricity generation , as well as its dependency on food imports and raw materials , makes Puerto Rico volatile and highly reactive to changes in the world economy and climate . Puerto Rico 's agricultural sector represents less than 1 % of GNP . Heavy debt load In early 2017 , the Puerto Rican government - debt crisis posed serious problems for the government which was saddled with outstanding bond debt that had climbed to $70 billion at a time with a 45 percent poverty rate and 12.4 % unemployment that is more than twice the mainland U.S. average . The debt had been increasing during a decade long recession . The Commonwealth had been defaulting on many debts , including bonds , since 2015 . With debt payments due , the Governor was facing the risk of a government shutdown and failure to fund the managed health care system . `` Without action before April , Puerto Rico 's ability to execute contracts for Fiscal Year 2018 with its managed care organizations will be threatened , thereby putting at risk beginning July 1 , 2017 the health care of up to 900,000 poor U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico '' , according to a letter sent to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human Services . They also said that `` Congress must enact measures recommended by both Republicans and Democrats that fix Puerto Rico 's inequitable health care financing structure and promote sustained economic growth . '' Initially , the oversight board created under PROMESA called for Puerto Rico 's governor Ricardo Rosselló to deliver a fiscal turnaround plan by January 28 . Just before that deadline , the control board gave the Commonwealth government until February 28 to present a fiscal plan ( including negotiations with creditors for restructuring debt ) to solve the problems . A moratorium on lawsuits by debtors was extended to May 31 . It is essential for Puerto Rico to reach restructuring deals to avoid a bankruptcy - like process under PROMESA . An internal survey conducted by the Puerto Rican Economists Association revealed that the majority of Puerto Rican economists reject the policy recommendations of the Board and the Rosselló government , with more than 80 % of economists arguing in favor of auditing the debt . In early August 2017 , the island 's financial oversight board ( created by PROMESA ) planned to institute two days off without pay per month for government employees , down from the original plan of four days per month ; the latter had been expected to achieve $218 million in savings . Governor Rossello rejected this plan as unjustified and unnecessary . Pension reforms were also discussed including a proposal for a 10 % reduction in benefits to begin addressing the $50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities . Public finances Main articles : Puerto Rico government - debt crisis , Budget of the Government of Puerto Rico , and public debt of Puerto Rico Puerto Rico has an operating budget of about U.S. $9.8 billion with expenses at about $10.4 billion , creating a structural deficit of $775 million ( about 7.9 % of the budget ) . The practice of approving budgets with a structural deficit has been done for 18 consecutive years starting in 2000 . Throughout those years , including present time , all budgets contemplated issuing bonds to cover these projected deficits rather than making structural adjustments . This practice increased Puerto Rico 's cumulative debt , as the government had already been issuing bonds to balance its actual budget for four decades since 1973 . The 2012 Budget of the Government of Puerto Rico Projected deficits added substantial burdens to an already indebted nation which accrued a public debt of $71 B or about 70 % of Puerto Rico 's gross domestic product . This sparked an ongoing government - debt crisis after Puerto Rico 's general obligation bonds were downgraded to speculative non-investment grade ( `` junk status '' ) by three credit rating agencies . In terms of financial control , almost 9.6 % -- or about $1.5 billion -- of Puerto Rico 's central government budget expenses for FY2014 is expected to be spent on debt service . Harsher budget cuts are expected as Puerto Rico must now repay larger chunks of debts in the following years . For practical reasons the budget is divided into two aspects : a `` general budget '' which comprises the assignments funded exclusively by the Department of Treasury of Puerto Rico , and the `` consolidated budget '' which comprises the assignments funded by the general budget , by Puerto Rico 's government - owned corporations , by revenue expected from loans , by the sale of government bonds , by subsidies extended by the federal government of the United States , and by other funds . Both budgets contrast each other drastically , with the consolidated budget being usually thrice the size of the general budget ; currently $29 B and $9.0 B respectively . Almost one out of every four dollars in the consolidated budget comes from U.S. federal subsidies while government - owned corporations compose more than 31 % of the consolidated budget . The critical aspects come from the sale of bonds , which comprise 7 % of the consolidated budget -- a ratio that increased annually due to the government 's inability to prepare a balanced budget in addition to being incapable of generating enough income to cover all its expenses . In particular , the government - owned corporations add a heavy burden to the overall budget and public debt , as none is self - sufficient . For example , in FY2011 the government - owned corporations reported aggregated losses of more than $1.3 B with the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority ( PRHTA ) reporting losses of $409 M , the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority ( PREPA ; the government monopoly that controls all electricity on the island ) reporting losses of $272 M , while the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority ( PRASA ; the government monopoly that controls all water utilities on the island ) reported losses of $112 M . Losses by government - owned corporations have been defrayed through the issuance of bonds compounding more than 40 % of Puerto Rico 's entire public debt today . Holistically , from FY2000 -- FY2010 Puerto Rico 's debt grew at a compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of 9 % while GDP remained stagnant . This has not always provided a long - term solution . In early July 2017 for example , the PREPA power authority was effectively bankrupt after defaulting in a plan to restructure $9 billion in bond debt ; the agency planned to seek Court protection . In terms of protocol , the governor , together with the Puerto Rico Office of Management and Budget ( OGP in Spanish ) , formulates the budget he believes is required to operate all government branches for the ensuing fiscal year . He then submits this formulation as a budget request to the Puerto Rican legislature before July 1 , the date established by law as the beginning of Puerto Rico 's fiscal year . While the constitution establishes that the request must be submitted `` at the beginning of each regular session '' , the request is typically submitted during the first week of May as the regular sessions of the legislature begin in January and it would be impractical to submit a request so far in advance . Once submitted , the budget is then approved by the legislature , typically with amendments , through a joint resolution and is referred back to the governor for his approval . The governor then either approves it or vetoes it . If vetoed the legislature can then either refer it back with amendments for the governor 's approval , or approve it without the governor 's consent by two - thirds of the bodies of each chamber . Once the budget is approved , the Department of Treasury disburses funds to the Office of Management and Budget which in turn disburses the funds to the respective agencies , while the Puerto Rico Government Development Bank ( the government 's intergovernmental bank ) manages all related banking affairs including those related to the government - owned corporations . Cost of living A map of Jones Act carrier routes for Puerto Rico The cost of living in Puerto Rico is high and has increased over the past decade . San Juan 's in particular is higher than Atlanta , Dallas , and Seattle but lower than Boston , Chicago , and New York City . One factor is housing prices which are comparable to Miami and Los Angeles , although property taxes are considerably lower than most places in the United States . Statistics used for cost of living sometimes do not take into account certain costs , such as the high cost of electricity , which has hovered in the 24 ¢ to 30 ¢ range per kilowatt / hour , two to three times the national average , increased travel costs for longer flights , additional shipping fees , and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers `` outside the continental United States '' . While some online stores do offer free shipping on orders to Puerto Rico , many merchants exclude Hawaii , Alaska , Puerto Rico and other United States territories . The household median income is stated as $19,350 and the mean income as $30,463 in the U.S. Census Bureau 's 2015 update . The report also indicates that 45.5 % of individuals are below the poverty level . The median home value in Puerto Rico ranges from U.S. $100,000 to U.S. $214,000 , while the national median home value sits at $119,600 . One of the most cited contributors to the high cost of living in Puerto Rico is the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 , also known as the Jones Act , which prevents foreign - flagged ships from carrying cargo between two American ports , a practice known as cabotage . Because of the Jones Act , foreign ships inbound with goods from Central and South America , Western Europe , and Africa can not stop in Puerto Rico , offload Puerto Rico - bound goods , load mainland - bound Puerto Rico - manufactured goods , and continue to U.S. ports . Instead , they must proceed directly to U.S. ports , where distributors break bulk and send Puerto Rico - bound manufactured goods to Puerto Rico across the ocean by U.S. - flagged ships . The local government of Puerto Rico has requested several times to the U.S. Congress to exclude Puerto Rico from the Jones Act restrictions without success . The most recent measure has been taken by the 17th Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico through R. Conc . del S. 21 . These measures have always received support from all the major local political parties . In 2013 the Government Accountability Office published a report which concluded that `` repealing or amending the Jones Act cabotage law might cut Puerto Rico shipping costs '' and that `` shippers believed that opening the trade to non-U.S. - flag competition could lower costs '' . However , the same GAO report also found that `` ( shippers ) doing business in Puerto Rico that GAO contacted reported that the freight rates are often -- although not always -- lower for foreign carriers going to and from Puerto Rico and foreign locations than the rates shippers pay to ship similar cargo to and from the United States , despite longer distances . Data were not available to allow us to validate the examples given or verify the extent to which this difference occurred . '' Ultimately , the report concluded that `` ( the ) effects of modifying the application of the Jones Act for Puerto Rico are highly uncertain '' for both Puerto Rico and the United States , particularly for the U.S. shipping industry and the military preparedness of the United States . Education Main article : Education in Puerto Rico The first school in Puerto Rico was the Escuela de Gramática ( Grammar School ) . It was established by Bishop Alonso Manso in 1513 , in the area where the Cathedral of San Juan was to be constructed . The school was free of charge and the courses taught were Latin language , literature , history , science , art , philosophy and theology . Education in Puerto Rico is divided in three levels -- Primary ( elementary school grades 1 -- 6 ) , Secondary ( intermediate and high school grades 7 -- 12 ) , and Higher Level ( undergraduate and graduate studies ) . As of 2002 , the literacy rate of the Puerto Rican population was 94.1 % ; by gender , it was 93.9 % for males and 94.4 % for females . According to the 2000 Census , 60.0 % of the population attained a high school degree or higher level of education , and 18.3 % has a bachelor 's degree or higher . Instruction at the primary school level is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 18 . As of 2010 , there are 1539 public schools and 806 private schools . The largest and oldest university system is the public University of Puerto Rico ( UPR ) with 11 campuses . The largest private university systems on the island are the Sistema Universitario Ana G. Mendez which operates the Universidad del Turabo , Metropolitan University and Universidad del Este . Other private universities include the multi-campus Inter American University , the Pontifical Catholic University , Universidad Politécnica de Puerto Rico , and the Universidad del Sagrado Corazón . Puerto Rico has four schools of Medicine and three ABA - approved Law Schools . Public health and safety As of 2015 medical care in Puerto Rico had been heavily impacted by emigration of doctors to the mainland and underfunding of the Medicare and Medicaid programs which serve 60 % of the island 's population . Affordable medical insurance under the Affordable Care Act is not available in Puerto Rico as , since Puerto Ricans pay no income tax , no subsidies are available . The city of San Juan has a system of triage , hospital , and preventive care health services . The municipal government sponsors regular health fairs in different areas of the city focusing on health care for the elderly and the disabled . In 2017 , there were 69 hospitals in Puerto Rico . There are twenty hospitals in San Juan , half of which are operated by the government . The largest hospital is the Centro Médico de Río Piedras ( the Río Piedras Medical Center ) . Founded in 1956 , it is operated by the Medical Services Administration of the Department of Health of Puerto Rico , and is actually a network of eight hospitals : San Juan Municipal Hospital : This hospital is operated by the San Juan municipal government . Industrial Hospital : This is the hospital for Puerto Rico government employees , whether municipal or Commonwealth government employees . Normally , injured police officers and firefighters are cared for here . San Juan Pediatric Hospital -- Also operated by the San Juan municipal government . Pediatric Hospital : Operated by the government of the Commonwealth , this is the main trauma hospital for pediatric cases . Centro Medico Emergency Room : This is the main hospital for trauma cases for Puerto Rico and the Caribbean . Centro Cardiovascular del Caribe ( Caribbean Cardiovascular Center ) : This is the main hospital for open heart surgery in the Caribbean . It features a hotel for the patients ' families . Psychiatric Hospital : The main psychiatric hospital in Puerto Rico . Operated by the government of Puerto Rico . Psychiatric Correctional Hospital : It is both a hospital and correctional facility . It is operated jointly by the Puerto Rico Department of Corrections and the Medical Services Administration . The city of San Juan operates nine other hospitals . Of these , eight are Diagnostic and Treatment Centers located in communities throughout San Juan . These nine hospitals are : La Perla Puerta de Tierra Llorens Torres Puerto Nuevo San José Río Piedras Sabana Llana Hoare Santurce Parada 19 There are also ten private hospitals in San Juan . These are : Hospital Metropilitano Hospital Auxilio Mutuo Hospital Auxilio Mutuo Expreso Hospital de Veteranos : The main Veterans hospital in the Caribbean . Operated by the U.S. Veteran Healthcare System . Ashford Presbyterian Hospital Hospital Pavia Hato Rey Hospital Pavia Santurce San Jorge Children 's Hospital : The most well known children 's hospital in the San Juan Metropolitan Area . Hospital San Gerardo : Located at the Cupey neighborhood , is a small hospital but is also specialized in psychiatry and elderly . Hospital del Maestro ( Teachers Hospital ) : Located in Hato Rey , this hospital is operated by the Puerto Rico Teachers Association . The city of Ponce is served by several clinics and hospitals . There are four comprehensive care hospitals : Hospital Dr. Pila , Hospital San Cristobal , Hospital San Lucas , and Hospital de Damas . In addition , Hospital Oncológico Andrés Grillasca specializes in the treatment of cancer , and Hospital Siquiátrico specializes in mental disorders . There is also a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic that provides health services to U.S. veterans . The U.S. Veterans Administration will build a new hospital in the city to satisfy regional needs . Hospital de Damas is listed in the U.S. News & World Report as one of the best hospitals under the U.S. flag . Ponce has the highest concentration of medical infrastructure per inhabitant of any municipality in Puerto Rico . On the island of Culebra , there is a small hospital in the island called Hospital de Culebra . It also offers pharmacy services to residents and visitors . For emergencies , patients are transported by plane to Fajardo on the main island . The town of Caguas has three hospitals : Hospital Hima San Pablo , Menonita Caguas Regional Hospital , and the San Juan Bautista Medical Center . The town of Cayey is served by the Hospital Menonita de Cayey , and the Hospital Municipal de Cayey . Reforma de Salud de Puerto Rico ( Puerto Rico Health Reform ) -- locally referred to as La Reforma ( The Reform ) -- is a government - run program which provides medical and health care services to the indigent and impoverished , by means of contracting private health insurance companies , rather than employing government - owned hospitals and emergency centers . The Reform is administered by the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration . Crime See also : Illegal drugs in Puerto Rico The overall rate of crime is low in Puerto Rico . The territory has a high firearm homicide rate . The homicide rate of 19.2 per 100,000 inhabitants was significantly higher than any U.S. state in 2014 . Most homicide victims are gang members and drug traffickers with about 80 % of homicides in Puerto Rico being drug related . Culture Main article : Culture of Puerto Rico Modern Puerto Rican culture is a unique mix of cultural antecedents : including European ( predominantly Spanish , Italian , French , German and Irish ) , African , and , more recently , some North American and lots of South Americans . A large number of Cubans and Dominicans have relocated to the island in the past few decades . From the Spanish , Puerto Rico received the Spanish language , the Catholic religion and the vast majority of their cultural and moral values and traditions . The United States added English - language influence , the university system and the adoption of some holidays and practices . On March 12 , 1903 , the University of Puerto Rico was officially founded , branching out from the `` Escuela Normal Industrial '' , a smaller organization that was founded in Fajardo three years before . Much of Puerto Rican culture centers on the influence of music and has been shaped by other cultures combining with local and traditional rhythms . Early in the history of Puerto Rican music , the influences of Spanish and African traditions were most noticeable . The cultural movements across the Caribbean and North America have played a vital role in the more recent musical influences which have reached Puerto Rico . The official symbols of Puerto Rico are the reinita mora or Puerto Rican spindalis ( a type of bird ) , the flor de maga ( a type of flower ) , and the ceiba or kapok ( a type of tree ) . The unofficial animal and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride is the coquí , a small frog . Other popular symbols of Puerto Rico are the jíbaro ( the `` countryman '' ) , and the carite . Architecture Main article : Architecture of Puerto Rico The architecture of Puerto Rico demonstrates a broad variety of traditions , styles and national influences accumulated over four centuries of Spanish rule , and a century of American rule . Spanish colonial architecture , Ibero - Islamic , art deco , post-modern , and many other architectural forms are visible throughout the island . From town to town , there are also many regional distinctions . Old San Juan Old San Juan is one of the two barrios , in addition to Santurce , that made up the municipality of San Juan from 1864 to 1951 , at which time the former independent municipality of Río Piedras was annexed . With its abundance of shops , historic places , museums , open air cafés , restaurants , gracious homes , tree - shaded plazas , and its old beauty and architectonical peculiarity , Old San Juan is a main spot for local and internal tourism . The district is also characterized by numerous public plazas and churches including San José Church and the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista , which contains the tomb of the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León . It also houses the oldest Catholic school for elementary education in Puerto Rico , the Colegio de Párvulos , built in 1865 . The oldest parts of the district of Old San Juan remain partly enclosed by massive walls . Several defensive structures and notable forts , such as the emblematic Fort San Felipe del Morro , Fort San Cristóbal , and El Palacio de Santa Catalina , also known as La Fortaleza , acted as the primary defenses of the settlement which was subjected to numerous attacks . La Fortaleza continues to serve also as the executive mansion for the Governor of Puerto Rico . Many of the historic fortifications are part of San Juan National Historic Site . During the 1940s , sections of Old San Juan fell into disrepair , and many renovation plans were suggested . There was even a strong push to develop Old San Juan as a `` small Manhattan '' . Strict remodeling codes were implemented to prevent new constructions from affecting the common colonial Spanish architectural themes of the old city . When a project proposal suggested that the old Carmelite Convent in San Juan be demolished to erect a new hotel , the Institute had the building declared as a historic building , and then asked that it be converted to a hotel in a renewed facility . This was what became the Hotel El Convento in Old San Juan . The paradigm to reconstruct and renovate the old city and revitalize it has been followed by other cities in the Americas , particularly Havana , Lima and Cartagena de Indias . Ponce Creole is an architectural style created in Ponce , Puerto Rico , in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . This style of Puerto Rican buildings is found predominantly in residential homes in Ponce that developed between 1895 and 1920 . Ponce Creole architecture borrows heavily from the traditions of the French , the Spaniards , and the Caribbean to create houses that were especially built to withstand the hot and dry climate of the region , and to take advantage of the sun and sea breezes characteristic of the southern Puerto Rico 's Caribbean Sea coast . It is a blend of wood and masonry , incorporating architectural elements of other styles , from Classical revival and Spanish Revival to Victorian . Arts Main article : Puerto Rican art Puerto Rican art reflects many influences , much from its ethnically diverse background . A form of folk art , called santos evolved from the Catholic Church 's use of sculptures to convert indigenous Puerto Ricans to Christianity . Santos depict figures of saints and other religious icons and are made from native wood , clay , and stone . After shaping simple , they are often finished by painting them in vivid colors . Santos vary in size , with the smallest examples around eight inches tall and the largest about twenty inches tall . Traditionally , santos were seen as messengers between the earth and Heaven . As such , they occupied a special place on household altars , where people prayed to them , asked for help , or tried to summon their protection . Also popular , caretas or vejigantes are masks worn during carnivals . Similar masks signifying evil spirits were used in both Spain and Africa , though for different purposes . The Spanish used their masks to frighten lapsed Christians into returning to the church , while tribal Africans used them as protection from the evil spirits they represented . True to their historic origins Puerto Rican caretas always bear at least several horns and fangs . While usually constructed of papier - mâché , coconut shells and fine metal screening are sometimes used as well . Red and black were the typical colors for caretas but their palette has expanded to include a wide variety of bright hues and patterns . Literature Main article : Puerto Rican literature Eugenio María de Hostos Puerto Rican literature evolved from the art of oral story telling to its present - day status . Written works by the native islanders of Puerto Rico were prohibited and repressed by the Spanish colonial government . Only those who were commissioned by the Spanish Crown to document the chronological history of the island were allowed to write . Diego de Torres Vargas was allowed to circumvent this strict prohibition for three reasons : he was a priest , he came from a prosperous Spanish family , and his father was a Sergeant Major in the Spanish Army , who died while defending Puerto Rico from an invasion by the Dutch armada . In 1647 , Torres Vargas wrote Descripción de la Ciudad e Isla de Puerto Rico ( `` Description of the Island and City of Puerto Rico '' ) . This historical book was the first to make a detailed geographic description of the island . The book described all the fruits and commercial establishments of the time , mostly centered in the towns of San Juan and Ponce . The book also listed and described every mine , church , and hospital in the island at the time . The book contained notices on the State and Capital , plus an extensive and erudite bibliography . Descripción de la Ciudad e Isla de Puerto Rico was the first successful attempt at writing a comprehensive history of Puerto Rico . Some of Puerto Rico 's earliest writers were influenced by the teachings of Rafael Cordero . Among these was Dr. Manuel A. Alonso , the first Puerto Rican writer of notable importance . In 1849 he published El Gíbaro , a collection of verses whose main themes were the poor Puerto Rican country farmer . Eugenio María de Hostos wrote La peregrinación de Bayoán in 1863 , which used Bartolomé de las Casas as a spring board to reflect on Caribbean identity . After this first novel , Hostos abandoned fiction in favor of the essay which he saw as offering greater possibilities for inspiring social change . In the late 19th century , with the arrival of the first printing press and the founding of the Royal Academy of Belles Letters , Puerto Rican literature began to flourish . The first writers to express their political views in regard to Spanish colonial rule of the island were journalists . After the United States invaded Puerto Rico during the Spanish -- American War and the island was ceded to the Americans as a condition of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 , writers and poets began to express their opposition to the new colonial rule by writing about patriotic themes . Alejandro Tapia y Rivera , also known as the Father of Puerto Rican Literature , ushered in a new age of historiography with the publication of The Historical Library of Puerto Rico . Cayetano Coll y Toste was another Puerto Rican historian and writer . His work The Indo - Antillano Vocabulary is valuable in understanding the way the Taínos lived . Dr. Manuel Zeno Gandía in 1894 wrote La Charca and told about the harsh life in the remote and mountainous coffee regions in Puerto Rico . Dr. Antonio S. Pedreira , described in his work Insularismo the cultural survival of the Puerto Rican identity after the American invasion . With the Puerto Rican diaspora of the 1940s , Puerto Rican literature was greatly influenced by a phenomenon known as the Nuyorican Movement . Puerto Rican literature continued to flourish and many Puerto Ricans have since distinguished themselves as authors , journalists , poets , novelists , playwrights , screenwriters , essayists and have also stood out in other literary fields . The influence of Puerto Rican literature has transcended the boundaries of the island to the United States and the rest of the world . Over the past fifty years , significant writers include Ed Vega , Luis Rafael Sánchez , Piri Thomas , Giannina Braschi , and Miguel Piñero . Esmeralda Santiago has written an autobiographical trilogy about growing up in modern Puerto Rico as well as an historical novel , Conquistadora , about life on a sugar plantation during the mid-19th century . Media Main article : Media in Puerto Rico The media in Puerto Rico includes local radio stations , television stations and newspapers , the majority of which are conducted in Spanish . There are also three stations of the U.S. Armed Forces Radio and Television Service . Newspapers with daily distribution are El Nuevo Dia , El Vocero and Indice , Metro , and Primera Hora . El Vocero is distributed free of charge as well as Indice and Metro . Newspapers distributed on a weekly or regional basis include Claridad , La Perla del Sur , La Opinion , Vision , and La Estrella del Norte , among others . Several television channels provide local content in the island . These include WIPR - TV , Telemundo , Univision Puerto Rico , WAPA - TV , and WKAQ - TV . Music Main article : Music of Puerto Rico Play media A dancer performs typical bomba choreography . The music of Puerto Rico has evolved as a heterogeneous and dynamic product of diverse cultural resources . The most conspicuous musical sources have been Spain and West Africa , although many aspects of Puerto Rican music reflect origins elsewhere in Europe and the Caribbean and , over the last century , from the U.S. Puerto Rican music culture today comprises a wide and rich variety of genres , ranging from indigenous genres like bomba , plena , aguinaldo , danza and salsa to recent hybrids like reggaeton . Puerto Rico has some national instruments , like the Cuatro ( Spanish for Four ) . The cuatro is a local instrument that was made by the `` Jibaro '' or people from the mountains . Originally , the Cuatro consisted of four steel strings , hence its name , but currently the Cuatro consists of five double steel strings . It is easily confused with a guitar , even by locals . When held upright , from right to left , the strings are G , D , A , E , B . In the realm of classical music , the island hosts two main orchestras , the Orquesta Sinfónica de Puerto Rico and the Orquesta Filarmónica de Puerto Rico . The Casals Festival takes place annually in San Juan , drawing in classical musicians from around the world . With respect to opera , the legendary Puerto Rican tenor Antonio Paoli was so celebrated , that he performed private recitals for Pope Pius X and the Czar Nicholas II of Russia . In 1907 , Paoli was the first operatic artist in world history to record an entire opera -- when he participated in a performance of Pagliacci by Ruggiero Leoncavallo in Milan , Italy . Over the past fifty years , Puerto Rican artists such as Jorge Emmanuelli , Yomo Toro , Ramito , Jose Feliciano , Bobby Capo , Rafael Cortijo , Ismael Rivera , Chayanne , Tito Puente , Eddie Palmieri , Ray Barreto , Dave Valentin , Omar Rodríguez - López , Hector Lavoe , Ricky Martin , Marc Anthony and Luis Fonsi have gained fame internationally . Cuisine Main article : Puerto Rican cuisine Cuchifritos ( Carnitas ) in New York Puerto Rican cuisine has its roots in the cooking traditions and practices of Europe ( Spain ) , Africa and the native Taínos . In the latter part of the 19th century , the cuisine of Puerto Rico was greatly influenced by the United States in the ingredients used in its preparation . Puerto Rican cuisine has transcended the boundaries of the island , and can be found in several countries outside the archipelago . Basic ingredients include grains and legumes , herbs and spices , starchy tropical tubers , vegetables , meat and poultry , seafood and shellfish , and fruits . Main dishes include mofongo , arroz con gandules , pasteles , alcapurrias and pig roast ( or lechón ) . Beverages include maví and piña colada . Desserts include flan , arroz con dulce ( sweet rice pudding ) , piraguas , brazo gitanos , tembleque , polvorones , and dulce de leche . Locals call their cuisine cocina criolla . The traditional Puerto Rican cuisine was well established by the end of the 19th century . By 1848 the first restaurant , La Mallorquina , opened in Old San Juan . El Cocinero Puertorriqueño , the island 's first cookbook was published in 1849 . Plantain `` arañitas '' and `` tostones rellenos '' From the diet of the Taíno people come many tropical roots and tubers like yautía ( taro ) and especially Yuca ( cassava ) , from which thin cracker - like casabe bread is made . Ajicito or cachucha pepper , a slightly hot habanero pepper , recao / culantro ( spiny leaf ) , achiote ( annatto ) , peppers , ají caballero ( the hottest pepper native to Puerto Rico ) , peanuts , guavas , pineapples , jicacos ( cocoplum ) , quenepas ( mamoncillo ) , lerenes ( Guinea arrowroot ) , calabazas ( tropical pumpkins ) , and guanabanas ( soursops ) are all Taíno foods . The Taínos also grew varieties of beans and some maize / corn , but maize was not as dominant in their cooking as it was for the peoples living on the mainland of Mesoamerica . This is due to the frequent hurricanes that Puerto Rico experiences , which destroy crops of maize , leaving more safeguarded plants like conucos ( hills of yuca grown together ) . Spanish / European influence is also seen in Puerto Rican cuisine . Wheat , chickpeas ( garbanzos ) , capers , olives , olive oil , black pepper , onions , garlic , cilantrillo ( cilantro ) , oregano , basil , sugarcane , citrus fruit , eggplant , ham , lard , chicken , beef , pork , and cheese all came to Borikén ( Puerto Rico 's native Taino name ) from Spain . The tradition of cooking complex stews and rice dishes in pots such as rice and beans are also thought to be originally European ( much like Italians , Spaniards , and the British ) . Early Dutch , French , Italian , and Chinese immigrants influenced not only the culture but Puerto Rican cooking as well . This great variety of traditions came together to form La Cocina Criolla . Coconuts , coffee ( brought by the Arabs and Corsos to Yauco from Kafa , Ethiopia ) , okra , yams , sesame seeds , gandules ( pigeon peas in English ) sweet bananas , plantains , other root vegetables and Guinea hen , all come to Puerto Rico from Africa .

Jump up ^ In 1932 , the U.S. Congress officially back - corrected the former Anglicization of Porto Rico into the Spanish name Puerto Rico . It had been using the former spelling in its legislative and judicial records since it acquired the territory . Patricia Gherovici states that both `` Porto Rico '' and `` Puerto Rico '' were used interchangeably in the news media and documentation before , during , and after the U.S. conquest of the island in 1898 . The `` Porto '' spelling , for instance , was used in the Treaty of Paris , but `` Puerto '' was used by The New York Times that same year . Nancy Morris clarifies that `` a curious oversight in the drafting of the Foraker Act caused the name of the island to be officially misspelled '' . However , Gervasio Luis Garcia traces the Anglicized spelling to a National Geographic article from 1899 , after which the spelling was kept by many agencies and entities because of the ethnic and linguistic pride of the English - speaking citizens of the American mainland .

With my vote , I make the initial request to the Federal Government to begin the process of the decolonization through : ( 1 ) Free Association : Puerto Rico should adopt a status outside of the Territory Clause of the Constitution of the United States that recognizes the sovereignty of the People of Puerto Rico . The Free Association would be based on a free and voluntary political association , the specific terms of which shall be agreed upon between the United States and Puerto Rico as sovereign nations . Such agreement would provide the scope of the jurisdictional powers that the People of Puerto Rico agree to confer to the United States and retain all other jurisdictional powers and authorities . Under this option the American citizenship would be subject to negotiation with the United States Government ; ( 2 ) Proclamation of Independence , I demand that the United States Government , in the exercise of its power to dispose of territory , recognize the national sovereignty of Puerto Rico as a completely independent nation and that the United States Congress enact the necessary legislation to initiate the negotiation and transition to the independent nation of Puerto Rico . My vote for Independence also represents my claim to the rights , duties , powers , and prerogatives of independent and democratic republics , my support of Puerto Rican citizenship , and a `` Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation '' between Puerto Rico and the United States after the transition process Jump up ^ Wyss , Jim . `` Will Puerto Rico become the newest star on the American flag ?

            "Document Text: Territorial evolution of the United States - wikipedia Territorial evolution of the United States Jump to : navigation , search The United States of America was created on July 4 , 1776 , with the declaration of independence of thirteen British colonies . Their independence was recognized by Great Britain with the Treaty of Paris of 1783 , following the American Revolutionary War . This effectively doubled the size of the colonies , now able to stretch west past the Proclamation Line to the Mississippi River . This land was organized into territories and then states , though there remained some conflict with the sea - to - sea grants claimed by some of the original colonies . In time , these grants were ceded to the federal government . The first great expansion of the country came with the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 , which doubled the country 's territory , but brought it into minor conflict with the colonies of Spain which eventually resulted in the acquisition of Spanish Florida . The Oregon Country gave the United States access to the Pacific Ocean , though it was shared for a time with the United Kingdom . The annexation of the Republic of Texas in 1845 led directly to the Mexican - American War , after which the victorious United States obtained Mexico 's northwestern quarter , including what was quickly made the state of California . However , as the development of the country moved west , the question of slavery became too much to ignore , as there was a struggle to keep the number of northern abolitionist states equal to the number of southern slave states , with vigorous debate over whether the new territories would allow slavery and events such as the Missouri Compromise and Bleeding Kansas . This came to a head in 1860 and 1861 , when the governments of the southern states proclaimed their secession from the country and formed the Confederate States of America . The American Civil War led to the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865 and the eventual readmission of the states to the United States Congress . The country 's expansion beyond North America began in 1856 with the passage of the Guano Islands Act , causing many small and uninhabited , but economically important , islands in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea to be claimed . Most of these claims were eventually abandoned due to competing claims from other countries or the guano having been mined out . The Pacific expansion culminated in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893 and its annexation in 1898 . Alaska , the last major acquisition in North America , was purchased from Russia in 1867 . Desires for expansion into Spanish territories like Cuba led to the Spanish - American War in 1898 , in which the United States gained Guam , Puerto Rico , and the Philippines , and occupied Cuba for several years . While the other two remain territories , the Philippines became independent in 1946 , after being a major theater of World War II . Following the war , many islands were entrusted to the U.S. by the United Nations , and while some remain U.S. territories , the Marshall Islands , Federated States of Micronesia , and Palau emerged from the trust territory as independent nations . The last major international change was the acquisition in 1904 , and return to Panama in 1979 , of the Panama Canal Zone , a region of American sovereignty to build and run the Panama Canal . The final cession of power over the region was made to Panama in 1999 . Regarding internal borders , while territories could shift wildly in size , once established a state has commonly remained within its borders , barring small changes due to river shifts . Only four states -- Maine , Kentucky , Vermont , and West Virginia -- have been created from land claimed by another state ; all of the others were created from territories or directly from acquisitions . The last state of the contiguous United States , commonly called the `` lower 48 , '' was admitted in 1912 ; the fiftieth and most recent state was admitted in 1959 .

Many states had vaguely defined and surveyed borders ; these are not noted as contested in the maps unless there was an active dispute . The borders of North Carolina were particularly poorly surveyed , its border with South Carolina having been done in several pieces , none of which truly matched the spirit of the charter , and its border with Virginia was only surveyed roughly halfway inland from the sea . Several northeastern states had overlapping claims : Connecticut , Massachusetts , and New York all claimed land west of their borders , overlapping with each other and with a sizable claim by Virginia . Of the three , only Connecticut seriously pursued its claims , while Virginia is considered to have had the most legitimate claim to the vast northwest , dividing it into counties and maintaining some limited control . The entirety of the new United States was claimed by Great Britain . Of particular note are Machias Seal Island and North Rock , two small islands off the northeast coast which remain disputed up to the present . Disputes : September 20 , 1776 The Counties of New Castle , Kent , and Sussex , upon Delaware enacted a constitution , renaming itself the Delaware State . September 28 , 1776 The State of Pennsylvania enacted a constitution , renaming itself the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania . no change to map December 20 , 1776 To avoid British forces who were advancing on Philadelphia , the Continental Congress began meeting in Baltimore . January 15 , 1777 The northeastern region of New York , known as the New Hampshire Grants , declared independence as New Connecticut . Disputes : March 4 , 1777 The Continental Congress returned to Philadelphia after the threat to it by British forces was ended . June 4 , 1777 New Connecticut was renamed Vermont . Disputes : September 27 , 1777 The Continental Congress fled Philadelphia after the American defeat at the Battle of Brandywine , and briefly met in Lancaster , Pennsylvania September 30 , 1777 The Continental Congress continued to move away from Philadelphia , settling in York , Pennsylvania . July 2 , 1779 The Continental Congress returned to Philadelphia following British withdrawal . August 31 , 1779 Virginia surrendered its claim to southwest Pennsylvania when the two states agreed to extend the Mason -- Dixon line westward to five degrees west of the Delaware River , with the border turning north from there . March 1780 North Carolina and Virginia surveyed their border further inland . Virginia 's survey reached to the Tennessee River , but North Carolina 's only went as far as the Cumberland Gap , and as the two surveys were roughly two miles apart , this created a thin area claimed by both states . Since the dispute only technically went as far west as the Cumberland Gap , beyond that point North Carolina 's line is faded to show that it was more an assumption , and beyond the Tennessee River both lines are faded . While the border was intended to follow parallel 36 ° 30 ′ north , early surveying errors caused it to veer north of that , reaching a distance of seventeen miles off by the time it reached the Tennessee River . October 25 , 1780 The State of Massachusetts Bay enacted a constitution , renaming itself the Commonwealth of Massachusetts . March 1 , 1781 The Articles of Confederation entered into force . no change to map April 4 , 1781 Vermont claimed what was called the `` East Union , '' consisting of some towns in New Hampshire that wished to join with Vermont due to a concern that their state was focusing too much on its coastal region . Vermont never gained full control over the area . The specific extent of the towns annexed is unknown , as township borders were often delineated only when a dispute arose ; the map uses the maximal interpretation . Disputes : June 16 , 1781 Vermont claimed what was called the `` West Union , '' consisting of some towns in New York , mainly to counterbalance Vermont 's attempt at eastward expansion . Vermont never gained full control over the area . ( The specific date this occurred is unclear ; sources suggest June 16 , June 26 , and July 18 ) . Disputes : February 22 , 1782 Vermont abandoned its attempts to annex the East Union from New Hampshire and the West Union from New York . Disputes : October 29 , 1782 The federal government accepted the cession from New York of its western claims , which the state ceded on February 17 , 1780 . At its maximum interpretation , New York claimed an area bordered by Lake Erie , Lake Huron and Lake Michigan ; to the Illinois , Mississippi , and Tennessee Rivers ; and north along the Appalachian Mountains , ending at the border with Pennsylvania . It is unclear from where this claim came ; many sources state that New York had surrendered it , but very few elaborate on how it was obtained . One source states that it was a cession by the Six Nations , who had conquered much of the region . However , New York never seriously enforced these claims . The cession included the western tip of New York , the Erie Triangle , formed by moving the western border of New York to a line 20 miles east of Presque Isle on Lake Erie . December 30 , 1782 The Congress of the Confederation declared that the land that Connecticut claimed in northern Pennsylvania was part of Pennsylvania , thus attempting to end the Pennamite -- Yankee War . The claim was an extension of Connecticut 's northernmost and southernmost borders westward , skipping New Jersey and New York , though as Connecticut 's northern border was a few miles north of Pennsylvania 's northern border , a small sliver of New York was also claimed . While conflict would continue for some time , this was the end of the formal claim by Connecticut . June 30 , 1783 The Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783 , and the Pennsylvania government reaction to it , caused the Congress of the Confederation to leave Philadelphia for Princeton . November 26 , 1783 The Congress of the Confederation reconvened in Annapolis . March 1 , 1784 Virginia ceded its claims northwest of the Ohio River to the federal government . Connecticut continued to claim its western lands that had overlapped Virginia 's cession . May 12 , 1784 Great Britain recognized the independence of the United States , ending its claim to the country , though borders with Great Britain were poorly defined in several areas in the north of the country . The treaty ended the American Revolutionary War , though military action had largely ended after the Franco - American victory at Yorktown on October 19 , 1781 . The Peace of Paris also involved treaties with France and Spain , with Great Britain ceding the Floridas to Spain . During their ownership of West Florida , the British had moved its border north , and the cession to Spain appeared to apply to the full extent of the British colony . However , the British - American treaty granted the extension of West Florida to the United States , where it enlarged Georgia south to the 31st parallel north , indicating that only the original definition of West Florida was to be ceded to Spain . The local Spanish governors also made a move to occupy forts along the Mississippi River , with claims to everything south of the Tennessee River ; it is unknown how official or strong these claims were , and they are not mapped as they are in conflict with the other Spanish claim involving the border of West Florida . Disputes : 1784 -- 1803 ( Organization of territory ) ( edit ) Date Event Change Map August 23 , 1784 A region in central North Carolina , unhappy with the state 's governance over the area , declared independence from the state as the State of Frankland . The government of Frankland held some control over the area , and petitioned for statehood , receiving support from seven of the nine states required , but would only last a few years . Unofficial change : November 1 , 1784 The Congress of the Confederation moved for a short time to Trenton . January 11 , 1785 The Congress of the Confederation moved to New York , and would settle there for five years . April 19 , 1785 The federal government accepted the cession from Massachusetts of its extreme western claim , which consisted of a strip of land west of Lake Huron and the Detroit River , bounded on the north by a line extending west from roughly halfway north through New Hampshire , and on the south by a line extending from the southern border of Massachusetts ' western half . The claim was never seriously enforced . Change on paper only : June 1785 The State of Frankland was renamed the State of Franklin , to encourage Benjamin Franklin to endorse the state , though he declined . Unofficial change : September 13 , 1786 Connecticut surrendered its western claim to the federal government except for its Western Reserve , though it is unclear how much control they held over the ceded region ; like the claim to Pennsylvania , this was a western extension of Connecticut 's northernmost and southernmost points . Change on paper only : December 16 , 1786 Massachusetts surrendered its claim to western New York , though it is unclear if Massachusetts ever held control over the region , as the claim was to the `` soil , not the sovereignty '' . This land , which was the area west of a north - south line 82 miles west of where the Delaware River entered New York , was later known as the Phelps and Gorham Purchase . It is likely that Massachusetts also claimed the Erie Triangle , but since this treaty was directly with New York , and New York had already ceded it to the federal government , it is not marked as being ceded by Massachusetts on the map . Change on paper only : July 13 , 1787 The Territory Northwest of the Ohio River , ceded earlier by Virginia , was organized and commonly became known as the Northwest Territory . August 9 , 1787 South Carolina ceded its western claim to the federal government , though it was a result of inaccurate geography and South Carolina never actually held claim to this land . The claim was of a strip of land between the border of North Carolina and the source of the Savannah River but , unknown at the time , the river originated in North Carolina . The eastern part of this cession would be given to Georgia in 1802 , despite Georgia technically already having claim to the land . Change on paper only : December 7 , 1787 Delaware became the first state to ratify the United States Constitution . no change to map December 12 , 1787 Pennsylvania became the second state to ratify the Constitution . no change to map December 18 , 1787 New Jersey became the third state to ratify the Constitution . no change to map January 2 , 1788 Georgia became the fourth state to ratify the Constitution . no change to map January 6 , 1788 Connecticut became the fifth state to ratify the Constitution . no change to map February 6 , 1788 Massachusetts became the sixth state to ratify the Constitution . no change to map April 28 , 1788 Maryland became the seventh state to ratify the Constitution . no change to map May 23 , 1788 South Carolina became the eighth state to ratify the Constitution . no change to map June 21 , 1788 New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify the Constitution ; at this point , the Constitution became the active governing document of the country . no change to map June 25 , 1788 Virginia became the tenth state to ratify the Constitution . no change to map July 26 , 1788 New York became the eleventh state to ratify the Constitution . no change to map February 1789 John Sevier , governor of the State of Franklin , pledged allegiance to North Carolina , effectively ending the claimed independence of Franklin . Unofficial change : August 7 , 1789 The Northwest Territory was reorganized under the Constitution . no change to map November 21 , 1789 North Carolina became the twelfth state to ratify the Constitution . no change to map April 2 , 1790 North Carolina ceded its western half to the federal government . May 26 , 1790 The land recently ceded by North Carolina was organized as the Territory South of the River Ohio , commonly known as the Southwest Territory . May 29 , 1790 Rhode Island became the thirteenth state to ratify the Constitution . no change to map December 6 , 1790 Per the Residence Act , the Congress of the United States relocated to Philadelphia for ten years until a federal district was built and ready . March 4 , 1791 Vermont , which had been considered part of New York despite acting independently since 1777 , was admitted as the fourteenth state . Disputes : March 30 , 1791 The District of Columbia , a federal district planned to house the federal government by 1800 , was formed from land ceded by Maryland and Virginia , consisting of a 100 square mile diamond straddling the Potomac River . However , it was not yet given that name , being simply referred to as the federal district . In September 1791 , the commissioners in charge of planning the city would term it the `` Territory of Columbia '' , and various laws refer to a District of Columbia , but sometimes informally . The area does not appear to have been formally named `` District of Columbia '' until at least the organic act of 1871 . Since the name `` Columbia '' was used from very early on , and at least informally by the government , the map will use `` District of Columbia '' starting from this date . March 3 , 1792 Pennsylvania purchased the Erie Triangle from the federal government . June 1 , 1792 The western half of Virginia , which the state had agreed in 1789 to cede to the federal government , was admitted as the fifteenth state , Kentucky . June 12 , 1792 The Delaware State enacted a new constitution , renaming itself the State of Delaware . no change to map February 29 , 1796 Great Britain agreed to abandon several forts in the northwest that it still occupied , including Detroit . no change to map April 25 , 1796 The northern half of West Florida was ceded by Spain , resolving the dispute over the region . Disputes : June 1 , 1796 The Southwest Territory was admitted as the sixteenth state , Tennessee . April 7 , 1798 Due to the Yazoo Land Fraud , an act authorized President John Adams to appoint commissioners to negotiate with Georgia about ceding its western land . The act created Mississippi Territory from the southwestern quarter of Georgia in the region recently ceded by West Florida , while maintaining that Georgia still held rights over the territory . June 9 , 1800 Connecticut ceded its Western Reserve to the federal government , which assigned it to the Northwest Territory . The act doing so was passed in Congress on April 28 , 1800 , and Connecticut approved it on this date . July 4 , 1800 Indiana Territory was organized from the Northwest Territory , west of a line from the mouth of the Kentucky River to Fort Recovery , and a line north from there . November 17 , 1800 The Congress of the United States moved to Washington in the District of Columbia , now built and ready to be the capital . This was two weeks before the December 1 date established in the Residence Act ; President John Adams urged Congress to move early in hopes of securing enough Southern votes to be re-elected , though this failed . January 1 , 1801 The Kingdom of Great Britain united with the Kingdom of Ireland , renaming itself the United Kingdom . February 27 , 1801 The District of Columbia was organized . no change to map April 26 , 1802 Georgia ceded its western half , known as the Yazoo Lands , to the federal government ; this region was west of the Chattahoochie River up to its great bend ( near West Point ) , then a line from there towards and past Nickajack . At the same time , the federal government ceded to Georgia the eastern portion of the land previously ceded by South Carolina , though in reality Georgia technically already held title to the land , as the description of the earlier cession was based on an erroneous understanding of geography . March 1 , 1803 The southern half of the Northwest Territory , along with a thin sliver of Indiana Territory , was admitted as the seventeenth state , Ohio . The remainder of the Northwest Territory was transferred to Indiana Territory . The western border was a line due north from the mouth of the Great Miami River to a point east from the southern tip of Lake Michigan . The federal description then said it should go east from there , whereas the Ohio Constitution stated it should intersect with the most northerly cape of Maumee Bay , essentially the western tip of Lake Erie . The confusion caused by these varying descriptions of the state 's borders , combined with inaccurate knowledge of geography , as no one at the time knew just how far south Lake Michigan extended , would lead to the conflict over the Toledo Strip . November 3 , 1803 The border between Tennessee and Virginia was resurveyed and established , ending the dispute over that part of the border . The border between Kentucky and Tennessee , despite following the original survey , remained vaguely defined . 1803 -- 1818 ( Purchase of Louisiana ) ( edit ) Date Event Change Map December 20 , 1803 The United States purchased Louisiana from France . This is the date of the formal turnover in New Orleans ; the purchase was completed on April 30 , 1803 . The transfer would be recognized in St. Louis in Upper Louisiana on March 10 , 1804 , known as Three Flags Day . The extent of what constituted Louisiana was disputed with Spain : the United States claimed the purchase included the part of West Florida west of the Perdido River , and the southwestern border with New Spain was disputed , as the United States claimed the Sabine River as the border , but Spain maintained it was the Calcasieu River and others . Disputes : 1804 The `` Southwick Jog '' was transferred from Connecticut to Massachusetts , to put to rest long - standing disagreements over the border between the two states . March 27 , 1804 The land between Tennessee and Mississippi Territory previously ceded by Georgia was assigned to Mississippi Territory . October 1 , 1804 Orleans Territory was organized from the Louisiana Purchase south of the 33rd parallel north , with the remainder being designated the District of Louisiana and placed under the jurisdiction of Indiana Territory . June 30 , 1805 Michigan Territory was organized from Indiana Territory , defined as north of a line east from the southern tip of Lake Michigan , and east of a line north from the lake 's northern tip . The southeastern portion of the border technically conflicted with the definition of Ohio , which claimed the Toledo Strip north of that line ; however , the exact position of Lake Michigan was not yet known . July 4 , 1805 The District of Louisiana was organized as Louisiana Territory . March 1 , 1809 Illinois Territory was organized from Indiana Territory , west of the Wabash River and a line north from Post Vincennes . September 26 , 1810 The Republic of West Florida declared independence from Spain . It maintained some control over its territory . Disputes : December 10 , 1810 Armed forces led by William C.C. Claiborne took possession of the portion of West Florida west of the Pearl River , following a proclamation on October 27 , 1810 , by President James Madison to do so . The United States had considered the region part of the Louisiana Purchase , including the area which had revolted against Spanish Florida and formed the Republic of West Florida . Madison 's proclamation stated that it was to be `` taken as part '' of Orleans Territory . The land west of Mobile Bay to the Pearl River was occupied and annexed de facto by the military in 1811 . Disputes : April 30 , 1812 Most of Orleans Territory was admitted as the eighteenth state , Louisiana . It was defined as the portion of the territory east of a line north from where the Sabine River crosses the 32nd parallel north , and west of the Mississippi and Iberville Rivers . The remainder presumably became unorganized territory , as it had no definition for a while . May 14 , 1812 The claimed portion of West Florida east of the Pearl River was assigned to Mississippi Territory , though the area around Mobile Bay remained under the control of Spanish Florida . The United States militarily occupied Mobile and the surrounding area up to the Perdido River in April 1813 . June 4 , 1812 Since its name was now shared with the state of Louisiana , Louisiana Territory was renamed Missouri Territory . August 4 , 1812 The remaining claimed portion of West Florida was added to Louisiana , following the assent of that state to an act passed by Congress on April 14 , 1812 . August 16 , 1812 During the War of 1812 , the garrison at Fort Detroit surrendered , leading the United Kingdom to occupy Detroit , the capital and population center of Michigan Territory . Disputes : September 29 , 1813 Fort Detroit was recaptured by American forces following the Battle of Lake Erie , regaining control over Michigan Territory . Disputes : August 24 , 1814 British forces capture and burn Washington , but are forced to withdraw the next day . The functions of the capital were only momentarily suspended , though President James Madison took refuge in Brookville , Maryland . no change to map December 11 , 1816 The southern part of Indiana Territory , along with small parts of Illinois Territory and Michigan Territory , were admitted as the nineteenth state , Indiana . The state was defined as the territory north of the Ohio River and east of the Wabash River , but while the territory 's line turned north at Post Vincennes , the state 's border continued up the Wabash until it reached the point where a line drawn north from Post Vincennes would last intersect the river as it weaved back and forth . The northern border of the state was a line east from 10 miles north of the southern tip of Lake Michigan , until it reached the meridian that formed Ohio 's western border . Thus , a very small portion of Indiana Territory was transferred to Illinois Territory around the Wabash , Indiana took its northern slice from Michigan Territory , and the remainder of Indiana Territory across Lake Michigan became unorganized territory . March 3 , 1817 Alabama Territory was organized from the eastern half of Mississippi Territory . Its western border was , from the north : the Tennessee River to Bear Creek ( around today 's Pickwick Lake ) ; a line from there to the northwestern corner of Washington County , Mississippi Territory ; and a line south from there . December 10 , 1817 Mississippi Territory was admitted as the twentieth state , Mississippi . February 6 , 1818 Alabama Territory created Tuskaloosa County with a description that inadvertently overlapped with Mississippi . It described the border of the county as running `` a due west course to , the Tombeckbe river ; thence up the same to the Cotton Gin Port '' . Unknown at the time , the origin of the Tombigbee River and Cotton Gin Port were in Mississippi . Change on paper only : June 30 , 1818 Per the terms of the Treaty of Ghent ending the War of 1812 , the United Kingdom returned Moose Island to Massachusetts , and the United States returned Campobello Island , Deer Island , and Grand Manan Island to the United Kingdom , all of which were captured from the other side during the war . no change to map December 3 , 1818 The half of Illinois Territory south of the parallel 42 ° 30 ′ north was admitted as the twenty - first state , Illinois . The remainder of the territory , along with the unorganized territory that was recently part of Indiana Territory , was assigned to Michigan Territory . 1819 -- 1845 ( northwest expansion ) ( edit ) Date Event Change Map January 30 , 1819 The Treaty of 1818 went into effect , setting the 49th parallel north as the border with the United Kingdom west of the Lake of the Woods , and also establishing the Oregon Country as a shared region with the United Kingdom . Oregon Country had no defined northern limit , but it can be assumed that it did not encroach much upon Russian - held lands ; this map uses the later - established line at the parallel 54 ° 40 ′ north for simplicity . Northwestern North America : July 4 , 1819 Arkansaw Territory was organized from Missouri Territory south of the parallel 36 ° 30 ′ north . December 14 , 1819 Alabama Territory was admitted as the twenty - second state , Alabama . The statehood act provided for a survey of the southern part of the border with Mississippi for correction if it was discovered to encroach upon Mississippi 's defined borders ; it was later discovered to do so . March 15 , 1820 As part of the Missouri Compromise , the District of Maine , the northern and separate part of Massachusetts , was admitted as the twenty - third state , Maine . April 21 , 1820 This is the earliest known date of the name `` Arkansas Territory '' being officially used instead of `` Arkansaw Territory '' . May 12 , 1820 The border between Kentucky and Tennessee was established . To make up for the fact that the border between the Cumberland Gap and the Tennessee River veered north as much as 17 miles from 36 ° 30 ′ north , a new survey was conducted starting at that point on the Mississippi River and moving east to the Tennessee River , hence granting Kentucky an addition in its southwest . July 19 , 1820 The overlap of the longitudinal southern border between Alabama and Mississippi was resolved , as per the act admitting Alabama as a state , because the provisional border encroached on Mississippi . As the result of a survey , the southern border terminus was moved about 3.8 miles to the east , which changed the border up to the then - northwest corner of Alabama 's Washington County . The date when this happened is unclear ; the sources available give either an unpublished report dated May 29 , 1820 , or the completion of the demarcation of the new line on July 19 , 1820 . Change on paper only : December 19 , 1820 Alabama redefined some county borders , ending its erroneous overlap of Mississippi created on February 6 , 1818 . Change on paper only : February 22 , 1821 The Adams -- Onís Treaty with Spain took effect . The many changes included : The border with the holdings of Spain was concretely defined ; previously , it had been the watershed of the Mississippi River and , for Oregon Country , the Columbia River , whereas now it followed specific rivers and parallels . The new border was defined as , starting in the south : The Sabine River to the 32nd parallel north , then north to the Red River of the South , following that to the 100th meridian west , then north to the Arkansas River to its source , then north from there to the 42nd parallel north and west to the ocean . The new border placed the `` Neutral Ground '' in Louisiana . Florida was ceded to the United States , although the formal transfer would not happen until July . Arkansas Territory had created Miller County south of the Red River , and this area was now on the Spanish side of the border . However , as this was a change made solely by the territory , and not by the federal government , in this map it is considered a domestic dispute . With Spanish West Florida being ceded , the dispute between it and Alabama , Louisiana , and Mississippi was resolved . Disputes : July 10 , 1821 East Florida was formally transferred to the United States by Spain . July 17 , 1821 West Florida was formally transferred to the United States by Spain . August 10 , 1821 The southeastern corner of Missouri Territory was admitted as the twenty - fourth state , Missouri , the rest becoming unorganized territory . It was defined as the area south of a line west from the Des Moines Rapids , and east of a line south from the mouth of the Kansas River . March 30 , 1822 The former East Florida and West Florida were organized as Florida Territory . May 26 , 1824 The western half of Arkansas Territory , bordered by a line south from a point 40 miles west of Missouri 's western border , was returned to unorganized territory . January 12 , 1825 A treaty with the Russian Empire established the parallel 54 ° 40 ′ north as the northern border of Oregon Country for American purposes ; a separate treaty created the same border between Russia and the United Kingdom . As this was likely the de facto border anyway , the region is already mapped with this line . no change to map May 6 , 1828 A treaty with the Cherokee moved the western border of Arkansas Territory , returning part of it to unorganized territory . The new border was defined as starting from where the land of the Eastern Choctaw met the Red River of the South , then north from there to the mouth of the Arkansas River , and from there to the southwestern corner of Missouri . July 9 , 1832 The northernmost region of New Hampshire , which was disputed with the United Kingdom , declared independence as the Republic of Indian Stream . While tiny , it does appear to have maintained some control over its territory . Disputes : June 28 , 1834 Michigan Territory gained a large parcel of land from unorganized territory on its west , extending to the Missouri River . August 5 , 1835 The Republic of Indian Stream recognized the jurisdiction of New Hampshire , thus ending its claimed independence . The date given is of a communication sent to British authorities ; other sources note a resolution passed by the citizens of Indian Stream on April 2 , 1836 . Disputes : June 15 , 1836 Arkansas Territory was admitted as the twenty - fifth state , Arkansas . July 3 , 1836 Wisconsin Territory was organized from the western bulk of Michigan Territory . The two large peninsulas between the Great Lakes remained in Michigan Territory ; the upper peninsula was included in exchange for the territory abandoning its claim to the Toledo Strip . The territory initially rejected this plan , but would accept it on December 14 . December 14 , 1836 Michigan Territory agreed to abandon its claim to the Toledo Strip , ending its dispute with Ohio . January 26 , 1837 Michigan Territory was admitted as the twenty - sixth state , Michigan . March 28 , 1837 The Platte Purchase transferred some land from unorganized territory to northwest Missouri , extending its northern border west to the Missouri River . July 3 , 1838 Iowa Territory was organized from Wisconsin Territory west of the Mississippi River . February 11 , 1839 Missouri claimed an area north of its border in Iowa Territory , initiating the long dispute known as the Honey War . May 21 , 1840 Proper surveying was conducted along the border between Arkansas and Texas , and the area claimed by Arkansas for Miller County was held not to belong to Arkansas . November 10 , 1842 The Webster -- Ashburton Treaty defined the border with the United Kingdom east of the Rocky Mountains . One source also mentions it very slightly altering the maritime boundary between Michigan and Wisconsin Territory . The treaty resolved the disputes over the northern borders of Maine , Michigan , New Hampshire , and Wisconsin Territory . The border between New York and Vermont on the one side , and the United Kingdom on the other , was clarified by the treaty . In 1816 , construction began on an unnamed fort nicknamed `` Fort Blunder '' on a peninsula in Lake Champlain that , while south of the surveyed border , was discovered to be north of the 45th parallel north , which was the border set by the Treaty of Paris and thus in British territory . Consequently , construction on the fort was abandoned . The Webster -- Ashburton Treaty specified that section of the border was to follow the surveyed line , rather than the exact parallel , thus moving the fort 's area into the United States , and a new fort , Fort Montgomery , would be built on the spot in 1844 . As the earlier line was surveyed , even though it did not match the definition , it was deemed to be the legitimate border . Disputes : July 5 , 1843 Local settlers created a provisional government for Oregon Country . While not official , it did maintain some jurisdiction over the area . Unofficial change : Northwestern North America : March 3 , 1845 Florida Territory was admitted as the twenty - seventh state , Florida . 1845 -- 1860 ( southwest expansion ) ( edit ) Date Event Change Map December 29 , 1845 The Republic of Texas was annexed and admitted as the twenty - eighth state , Texas . Texas brought with it a substantial territorial dispute with Mexico . While many sources state that Mexico recognized the independence of the eastern portion of Texas , the treaties were rejected by the Mexican government . Texas formally handed over sovereignty to the United States in a ceremony on February 19 , 1846 . The annexation led to the beginning of the Mexican -- American War a few months later . Disputes : June 15 , 1846 The Oregon Treaty established the 49th parallel north west of the Lake of the Woods as the continental border ( so it did not include Vancouver Island ) with land held by the United Kingdom . The sharing of Oregon Country ended , and the United States portion became unorganized territory . The treaty was vague on which strait should be the border between Vancouver Island and the continent , thus causing a dispute over ownership of the San Juan Islands . It specified `` through the middle of the said channel and of Fuca Straits , to the Pacific Ocean '' . Northwestern North America : Disputes : September 22 , 1846 Following the capture on August 18 , 1846 , of Santa Fe , the capital of the Mexican territory of Santa Fe de Nuevo México , a code of laws known as the Kearny Code was created for the area . The region overlapped with Texas ' claim , though Texas had little to no control over the area outside of its eastern quarter . Unofficial change : December 28 , 1846 The southern portion of Iowa Territory , south of parallel 43 ° 30 ′ north and east of the Big Sioux River , was admitted as the twenty - ninth state , Iowa . The remainder became unorganized territory . March 13 , 1847 The District of Columbia retroceded Alexandria County back to Virginia . Congress passed the act on July 9 , 1846 , residents of Alexandria County were proclaimed by the president to have agreed to it on September 7 , 1846 , and Virginia took possession of the land on this date . May 29 , 1848 The southern bulk of Wisconsin Territory , mainly east of the St. Croix River , was admitted as the thirtieth state , Wisconsin . The remainder became unorganized territory . However , the citizens of the remainder decided to continue on with a civil government , and even elected a delegate to the United States House of Representatives who would be seated on January 15 , 1849 , essentially making this region a de facto continuation of Wisconsin Territory . July 4 , 1848 The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican -- American War and ceded a large parcel of land from Mexico , consisting of its territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo México , and its claim to Texas . Due to a disagreement over the southern border of Santa Fe de Nuevo México , a border dispute began . Disputes : August 14 , 1848 Oregon Territory was organized from the unorganized territory that was formerly part of Oregon Country . February 13 , 1849 The boundary dispute between Iowa and Missouri known as the Honey War was resolved by the Supreme Court of the United States . The resulting border was the Sullivan Line that existed before the dispute , roughly splitting the two claims . March 3 , 1849 Minnesota Territory was organized from unorganized territory east of the Missouri River and the region that had been operating as de facto Wisconsin Territory . March 12 , 1849 A local government formed the State of Deseret and claimed a vast portion of the southwest , including most of the Mexican Cession . Though it petitioned to be admitted to the United States , the proposal was rejected and , in 1850 , Utah Territory was formed instead . The claimed area overlapped slightly with Texas ' claimed area , as well as part of Oregon Territory . Unofficial change : September 9 , 1850 The western portion of the Mexican Cession , west of the 120th meridian west , a diagonal line from where that intersects the 39th parallel north to where the Colorado River intersects the 35th parallel north , and the Colorado River , was admitted as the thirty - first state , California . The portion of the remainder north of the 37th parallel north and west of the summit of the Rocky Mountains was organized as Utah Territory . Part of Utah Territory overlapped with the portion of Texas that would be purchased on December 13 , 1850 , but the law authorizing the purchase was passed on this day , so the borders of Utah Territory assumed the purchase will go through . December 9 , 1850 The United Kingdom ceded less than one acre of underwater rock known as Horseshoe Reef in Lake Erie near Buffalo , New York for a lighthouse . It was surrounded by British waters , thus creating a form of enclave . December 13 , 1850 The federal government purchased the western claims of Texas . New Mexico Territory was organized from the part of this land east of the Rio Grande , along with the remaining unorganized territory from the Mexican Cession . New Mexico Territory included all of the area that had been governed under the Kearny Code . April 5 , 1851 The State of Deseret dissolved itself , its functions and territory largely having been superseded by Utah Territory . Unofficial change : March 2 , 1853 Washington Territory was organized from the half of Oregon Territory north of the 46th parallel north and the Columbia River . May 30 , 1854 Kansas Territory was organized from unorganized territory north of the 37th parallel north , and Nebraska Territory was organized north of 40th parallel north . Much of the remaining unorganized territory , east of the 100th meridian west , became known as Indian Territory , designated as a place to resettle Indian tribes . A small strip between the Texas Panhandle and Kansas Territory was unclaimed , due to falling south of Kansas Territory 's border but north of the 36 ° 30 ′ latitude established in the Missouri Compromise as the northern limit of slavery , and thus Texas could not have it . This became known as the Public Land Strip , or sometimes `` No Man 's Land '' . June 30 , 1854 The United States purchased a large parcel from Mexico known as the Gadsden Purchase , as it offered a much better route for a southern transcontinental railroad . This resolved the border dispute , since the disputed land was included in the purchase . The purchase was defined as : starting from where the Rio Grande crosses parallel 31 ° 47 ' north ; then west 100 miles ; then south to parallel 31 ° 20 ' north ; then west to the 111th meridian west ; then a line from there to a point on the Colorado River 20 miles below the mouth of the Gila River ; and the Colorado River . Disputes : August 4 , 1854 The recently obtained Gadsden Purchase was assigned to New Mexico Territory . January 11 , 1855 Due to its remote location , Boston Corner was transferred from Massachusetts to New York . March 6 , 1855 The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Florida in a boundary dispute with Georgia , setting the state boundary line along McNeil 's line . no change to map October 28 , 1856 Baker Island and Jarvis Island were claimed under the Guano Islands Act . Pacific Ocean : May 11 , 1858 The half of Minnesota Territory east of the Red River of the North , the Bois de Sioux River , and a line south from the southern tip of Big Stone Lake , was admitted as the thirty - second state , Minnesota .

March 1 , 1867 Nebraska Territory was admitted as the thirty - seventh state , Nebraska . July 1 , 1867 Canada was formed from several British colonies , including New Brunswick , thus inheriting the dispute over Machias Seal Island and North Rock .

The territory would remain under the jurisdiction of the Dakota Territory until its own government was organized on May 19 , 1869 . The act organizing Wyoming Territory became law on this date , but it is unclear if the territory could be considered `` organized '' until May 19 , 1869 , as the act specifies it was not to take effect until a government is organized ; however , all sources use this date as the creation , and most use it for the organization , of the territory . A tiny portion of the Dakota Territory was erroneously left behind on the western side of Wyoming Territory . August 12 , 1868 The list of bonded guano island claims mentions `` Islands in Caribbean Sea not named '' bonded on this date , but it is unknown what this is referring to . no change to map December 11 , 1868 Serrana Bank was claimed under the Guano Islands Act .

Pacific Ocean : March 3 , 1879 The border across the Chesapeake Bay between Maryland and Virginia was decided via arbitration . The new border cuts across Smith Island , likely meaning that the southern portion of the island was transferred to Virginia , but due to the general lack of concrete borders in the area for so long due to surveying errors , it is unknown if any land actually changed hands . too vague to map September 8 , 1879 Arenas Key , claimed by Mexico , and Serranilla Bank , claimed by Colombia , were claimed by the United States under the Guano Islands Act ; according to the Office of Insular Affairs , Serranilla Bank was claimed again on September 13 , 1880 . Caribbean Sea : April 7 , 1880 A very small area of Vermont near Fair Haven was transferred to New York due to a change in the course in the Poultney River . The specific area was very small and poorly documented , so it is not mapped . too small to map September 13 , 1880 Western Triangle Island , claimed by Mexico , was claimed by the United States under the Guano Islands Act . The list of bonded claims also mentions a `` De Anes '' island claimed on this date , with coordinates matching Isla de Aves ; however , the same list points out that the claim to `` Aves Island '' was found to be invalid . Caribbean Sea : 1881 Flint Island was claimed by the United Kingdom . Pacific Ocean : May 23 , 1882 The area between the 43rd parallel north and the Keya Paha and Niobrara Rivers was transferred from Dakota Territory to Nebraska . The act was passed in Congress on March 28 and accepted by the Nebraska legislature on this date . June 1 , 1882 The Morant Cays and Pedro Cays were annexed by the United Kingdom to Jamaica ; it appears they were no longer claimed by the United States after this .

Northwestern North America : June 21 , 1884 The Alacrans Islands , claimed by Mexico , were claimed under the Guano Islands Act .

Pacific Ocean : March 17 , 1888 Christmas Island was claimed by the United Kingdom .

March 8 , 1892 The Gilbert Islands became a protectorate of the United Kingdom , thus initiating a claim on Butaritari and Marakei . No record of a United States claim exists after this point , so it is assumed this is when the claim fell dormant . Pacific Ocean : May 28 , 1892 Gardner Island was claimed by the United Kingdom . Pacific Ocean : September 16 , 1893 Per a treaty with the Cherokee , the federal government purchased the Cherokee Outlet in the Indian Territory and opened it to settlement , transferring it to Oklahoma Territory as provided in the Oklahoma Organic Act .

The ceremony to transfer sovereignty occurred on this date ; the act was signed on July 7 , 1898 . Johnston Atoll was not included with Hawaii , nor was Sikaiana Atoll , which had been ceded to Hawaii in 1856 by its residents and approved by King Kamehameha IV . However , the annexation was based on the islands named in a report of the Hawaiian Commission , which omitted Sikaiana . Pacific Ocean : January 17 , 1899 Wake Island was claimed . Pacific Ocean : April 11 , 1899 Guam , Porto Rico , and , after a payment of $20 million , the Philippines were ceded by Spain following the Spanish -- American War . The Philippines were claimed by the First Philippine Republic . The ceded region for the Philippines included the island of Palmas , which was administered by the Netherlands . This overlap would not be noticed until January 21 , 1906 . While the United States occupied Cuba for a time , it was not ceded nor claimed . Pacific Ocean : Caribbean Sea : February 16 , 1900 The United States took ownership of the Samoan Islands east of the 171st meridian west , per the terms of the Tripartite Convention . Pacific Ocean : February 19 , 1900 The newly acquired Samoan islands were established as Naval Station , Tutuila . It included all of the islands granted by the Tripartite Convention , though formal cession of the islands by local authorities would take place later in 1900 and 1904 . Pacific Ocean : April 10 , 1900 The island of Tutuila was formally ceded to the United States and added to Naval Station , Tutuila . As the United States had already claimed the island on February 19 , 1900 , no change is mapped . The treaty would be ratified by Congress on February 20 , 1929 . no change to map April 12 , 1900 Porto Rico was organized into a civil territory . no change to map June 14 , 1900 The former Republic of Hawaii was organized into Hawaii Territory . Pacific Ocean : March 3 , 1901 The transfer for a thin sliver of Bristol , Tennessee , to Bristol , Virginia , was approved by Congress after having been approved by both states . The location of the border along Main Street ( now State Street ) between the two cities was either the northern sidewalk of the street , or down the middle of the street ; Tennessee 's cession of the northern half of the street laid the issue to rest . too small to map March 23 , 1901 The president of the First Philippine Republic , Emilio Aguinaldo , was captured , and the republic was dissolved . The islands of Cagayan de Sulu and Sibutu , and their associated islands , were purchased from Spain and assigned to the Philippines . The borders specified in the Treaty of Paris of 1898 had excluded these islands ; the new treaty simply ceded `` any and all islands belonging to the Philippine Archipelago '' . Pacific Ocean : February 23 , 1903 Land along southern Guantánamo Bay was leased in perpetuity from Cuba for use as a naval base . no change to map October 20 , 1903 The Alaska boundary dispute with Canada was resolved , generally in favor of the United States claim . Northwestern North America : May 4 , 1904 The United States took ownership of the Panama Canal Zone . At this stage , only the most basic borders were defined ; it was a zone surrounding the canal on each side for five miles , but excluded the cities of Colón and Panama City , which remained exclaves of Panama , as well as the water for their harbors . The Hay -- Bunau - Varilla Treaty granting it to the United States was ratified on February 26 , 1904 . A formal border agreement , which also gave the Canal Zone some land and a lighthouse in northwest Colón , would be ratified on June 15 , 1904 . Caribbean Sea : July 16 , 1904 The Manuʻa islands were formally ceded to the United States and added to Naval Station , Tutuila . As the United States had already claimed the islands on February 19 , 1900 , no change is mapped . The treaty would be ratified by Congress on February 20 , 1929 . no change to map December 12 , 1904 The `` Taft Agreement '' was made with Panama on December 3 , with one of its sections refining the maritime boundary of the harbor of Panama City and the Panama Canal Zone . It became effective December 12 . no change to map February 10 , 1905 The border between Arkansas and Indian Territory was slightly adjusted near Fort Smith , Arkansas , transferring a small amount of land on the east side of the Poteau River to Arkansas . November 16 , 1907 Indian Territory and Oklahoma Territory were combined and admitted as the forty - sixth state , Oklahoma . April 11 , 1908 A boundary treaty with the United Kingdom on behalf of Canada redefined the maritime borders between the United States and Canada . Among other changes , this `` de-enclaved '' Horseshoe Reef in Lake Erie by making the water around it contiguous with the water on the American side of the border . no change to map January 1 , 1909 The new Constitution of Michigan included some area of Wisconsin within its definition of Michigan . August 20 , 1910 A boundary treaty with the United Kingdom on behalf of Canada addressed a slight uncertainty in the maritime border in Passamaquoddy Bay between Maine and Canada . The border was adjusted to run east of Pope 's Folly Island , which previously lay on the border line , and had been the subject of some debate for many years . July 17 , 1911 Naval Station , Tutuila , was renamed American Samoa ; the station continued to operate separate from territorial governance until 1951 . Pacific Ocean : January 6 , 1912 New Mexico Territory was admitted as the forty - seventh state , New Mexico . February 14 , 1912 Arizona Territory was admitted as the forty - eighth state , Arizona . August 24 , 1912 The District of Alaska was reorganized as the Alaska Territory .

August 5 , 1914 The Corn Islands were leased from Nicaragua for a period of 99 years ; however , this was not a full transfer of sovereignty , and the islands were never administered as an insular area . no change to map May 1 , 1915 The borders of the Panama Canal Zone were explicitly defined . Whereas the original definition was a simple corridor surrounding the canal , this treaty specified the actual border . Among the changes this caused were : a slice of Canal Zone was ceded to Panama so Panama City would be connected with the rest of the country ; the middle island of the Las Tres Hermanas Islands , which marked the border of Panama City 's harbor , was wholly made part of Canal Zone ; Gatun Lake and other surrounding waters were formally annexed to the territory ; and an area of northwest Colón was ceded to Canal Zone . Caribbean Sea : May 27 , 1915 Under Article II of the 1903 Treaty , the United States expropriated from Panama several areas around the mouth of the Rio Chagres , annexing them to the Panama Canal Zone . too small to map December 8 , 1915 The United States expropriated from Panama a triangle of land , which included the historic Fort San Lorenzo , between the Rio Chagres , Caribbean Sea and the Panama Canal Zone , to which it was annexed . too small to map January 17 , 1916 Navassa Island was formally claimed for lighthouse purposes . no change to map March 31 , 1917 The Danish Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark and renamed the United States Virgin Islands .

That area was enlarged to about 50 hectares within several months . too small to map August 21 , 1918 The United States expropriated from Panama land between the Rio Chagres and the Quebrada Majagual and annexed it to the Panama Canal Zone . Caribbean Sea : September 13 , 1918 Minnesota and Wisconsin exchanged islands in the Mississippi River : Island Seventytwo was transferred from Wisconsin to the Minnesota town of Winona , and Barron 's Island was transferred from Minnesota to the Wisconsin town of La Crosse .

Caribbean Sea : June 16 , 1920 Fifteen hectares on the island of Taboga Island were annexed to the Panama Canal Zone . too small to map June 30 , 1921 The `` Wedge '' dispute between Delaware and Pennsylvania was resolved in Delaware 's favor . The disputed land had generally been administered by Delaware , even electing a member of the Delaware legislature in the mid-19th century , but federal maps had included the land as part of Pennsylvania at least as late as 1900 . The states had agreed on a resolution , and it was affirmed by an act of Congress on this date . Some sources , contemporary and modern , note that , in the original process of resurveying the border in 1892 , a very thin , horn - shaped region along the arc was transferred from Delaware to Pennsylvania ; however , no federal maps found reflect this , and it is unclear if this transfer actually occurred . May 10 , 1922 Kingman Reef was formally annexed . no change to map October 8 , 1923 Michigan expanded its claim to Wisconsin territory , though Wisconsin never lost control over the area . November 15 , 1923 The Swan Islands were claimed by Honduras .

Caribbean Sea : March 4 , 1925 Swains Island was added to American Samoa . Pacific Ocean : July 17 , 1925 The border with Canada was adjusted in several places . The only change to a land border redefined how the border between the Lake of the Woods and the Rocky Mountains should be considered ; previously , the border followed the curve of the parallel between each border monument , while the treaty changed this to straight lines between each monument . Through this , the United States netted a gain of between 30 and 35 acres of land . Due to the extremely small shift , the lack of specific documentation of where the changes occurred , and the lack of any human impact , this change is not mapped . There was also a change to the border in the Lake of the Woods ; due to inaccurate surveying , the previous border intersected itself several times in the lake , creating enclaves of United States water surrounded by Canadian water . The treaty changed the border to use the southernmost intersection as the northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods . Finally , the maritime border in the Bay of Fundy was adjusted , netting Canada roughly 9 acres of water . too small to map March 1 , 1926 The Supreme Court of the United States resolved the conflict between Michigan and Wisconsin in the favor of Wisconsin . July 29 , 1926 Johnston Atoll was established as a federal bird refuge and placed under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Agriculture . The atoll had originally been claimed by both the United States and Hawaii in 1858 , but little activity apart from guano mining had taken place , and it had been largely abandoned for decades . no change to map November 22 , 1926 The Supreme Court of the United States defined the border between Michigan and Wisconsin , transferring all islands south of the Quinnesec Falls on the Menominee River to Wisconsin , and all islands north of the falls to Michigan ; it is unknown specifically which islands were transferred in this fashion . However , an error in the border description introduced a small overlap between the two states over several islands in Lake Michigan north of the Door Peninsula . July 18 , 1927 The United States expropriated from Panama another 33 hectares of land on the islands of Taboga and Taboguilla and annexed them to the Panama Canal Zone . too small to map October 26 , 1927 Two bancos along the Colorado River were ceded from Mexico to Arizona . too small to map December 5 , 1927 The `` Country Club Dispute '' between New Mexico and Texas was resolved in Texas 's favor .

The Royal Courts of Justice on the Strand in London is the seat of the High Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal . English law is the common law legal system of England and Wales , comprising mainly criminal law and civil law , each branch having its own courts and procedures .

In the absence of any statutory law , the common law with its principle of stare decisis forms the residual source of law , based on judicial decisions , custom , and usage . Its essence is that it is made by sitting judges applying both statutory law and the body of common law principles which have been established over the years from the reasoning of decisions in previous legal cases . A decision of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom , the highest civil appeal court of the United Kingdom , is binding on every other court . Equity is a further source of judge - made law . International treaties such as the European Union 's Treaty of Rome or the Hague - Visby Rules have effect in English law only when adopted and ratified by Act of Parliament . Adopted treaties may be subsequently denounced by executive action . Not being a civil law system , English law has no comprehensive codification . However , most of its criminal law has been codified from its common law origins , in the interests both of certainty and of ease of prosecution . For the time being , murder remains a common law crime rather than a statutory offence . Common law can be amended or repealed by Parliament ; for example section 4 of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 effectively overrules Grant v Norway . Following Montesquieu 's theory of the `` separation of powers '' , only Parliament has the power to legislate ; but in the event of a statute being ambiguous , only the courts have the power to decide its true meaning , using the principles of statutory interpretation . The courts have no authority to legislate , so the `` legal fiction '' is that they `` declare '' ( rather than `` create '' ) the common law . The House of Lords took this `` declaratory power '' a stage further in DPP v Shaw , where , in creating the new crime of `` conspiracy to corrupt public morals '' , Viscount Simonds claimed the court had a `` residual power to protect the moral welfare of the state '' . Although Scotland and Northern Ireland form part of the United Kingdom , they have separate legal systems , although they share Westminster as a primary legislature , and Supreme Court decisions of any UK country is binding on the others , as in Donoghue v Stevenson . Even though Scotland became part of the UK over 300 years ago , Scots law has remained remarkably distinct from English law . Statute law ( edit ) Statutory framework ( edit ) The first schedule of the Interpretation Act 1978 , defines the following terms : `` British Islands '' , `` England '' , and `` United Kingdom '' . The use of the term `` British Isles '' is virtually obsolete in statutes and , when it does appear , it is taken to be synonymous with `` British Islands '' . For interpretation purposes , England includes a number of specified elements : Wales and Berwick Act 1746 , section 3 ( entire Act now repealed ) formally incorporated Wales and Berwick - upon - Tweed into England . But section 4 Welsh Language Act 1967 provided that references to England in future Acts of Parliament should no longer include Wales ( see now Interpretation Act 1978 , Schedule 3 , part 1 ) . But Dicey & Morris say ( at p28 ) `` It seems desirable to adhere to Dicey 's ( the original ) definition for reasons of convenience and especially of brevity . It would be cumbersome to have to add `` or Wales '' after `` England '' and `` or Welsh '' after `` English '' every time those words are used . '' the `` adjacent islands '' of the Isle of Wight and Anglesey are a part of England and Wales by custom , while Harman v Bolt ( 1931 ) 47 TLR 219 expressly confirms that Lundy is a part of England . the `` adjacent territorial waters '' by virtue of the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act 1878 and the Continental Shelf Act 1964 as amended by the Oil and Gas Enterprise Act 1982 . `` Great Britain '' means England , Wales , Scotland , their adjacent territorial waters and the islands of Orkney and Shetland , the Hebrides and , by virtue of the Island of Rockall Act 1972 , Rockall . `` United Kingdom '' means Great Britain and Northern Ireland and their adjacent territorial waters , but not the Isle of Man , nor the Channel Islands , whose independent status was discussed in Rover International Ltd. v Canon Film Sales Ltd. ( 1987 ) 1 WLR 1597 and Chloride Industrial Batteries Ltd. v F. & W. Freight Ltd. ( 1989 ) 1 WLR 823 . `` British Islands '' -- but not `` British Isles '' -- means the United Kingdom , the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands . Types of statute law ( edit ) Acts of the Old Irish Parliament Acts of the Scottish Parliament Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament Measures of the Northern Ireland Assembly Measures of the National Assembly for Wales Acts of the National Assembly for Wales Ministerial Order Northern Ireland Statutory Rules UK Statutory Instruments Citation style ( edit ) Main article : Short title Statutes are cited in this fashion : `` Short Title Year '' , e.g. Theft Act 1968 . By contrast , American convention inserts `` of '' , as in `` Civil Rights Act of 1964 '' . This became the usual way to refer to Acts in the second half of the 19th century , starting in the 1840s ; previously Acts were referred to by their long title together with the regnal year of the parliamentary session in which they received Royal Assent , and the chapter number . For example , the Pleading in English Act 1362 was referred to as 36 Edw . III c. 15 , meaning `` 36th year of the reign of Edward III , chapter 15 '' , though in the past this was all spelt out , together with the long title . Common law ( edit ) Description ( edit ) Common law is a term with historical origins in the legal system of England . It denotes , in the first place , the judge - made law that developed from the early Middle Ages as described in a work published at the end of the 19th century , The History of English Law before the Time of Edward I , in which Pollock and Maitland expanded the work of Coke ( 17th century ) and Blackstone ( 18th century ) . Specifically , the law developed in England 's Court of Common Pleas and other common law courts , which became also the law of the colonies settled initially under the crown of England or , later , of the United Kingdom , in North America and elsewhere ; and this law as further developed after those courts in England were reorganised by the Supreme Court of Judicature Acts passed in the 1870s , and developed independently , in the legal systems of the United States and other jurisdictions , after their independence from the United Kingdom , before and after the 1870s . The term is used , in the second place , to denote the law developed by those courts , in the same periods ( pre-colonial , colonial and post-colonial ) , as distinct from within the jurisdiction , or former jurisdiction , of other courts in England : the Court of Chancery , the ecclesiastical courts , and the Admiralty court . In the Oxford English Dictionary ( 1933 ) `` common law '' is described as `` The unwritten law of England , administered by the King 's courts , which purports to be derived from ancient usage , and is embodied in the older commentaries and the reports of abridged cases '' , as opposed , in that sense , to statute law , and as distinguished from the equity administered by the Chancery and similar courts , and from other systems such as ecclesiasical law , and admiralty law . For usage in the United States the description is `` the body of legal doctrine which is the foundation of the law administered in all states settled from England , and those formed by later settlement or division from them '' . Early development ( edit ) Since 1189 , English law has been described as a common law rather than a civil law system ; in other words , no comprehensive codification of the law has taken place and judicial precedents are binding as opposed to persuasive . This may be a legacy of the Norman conquest of England , when a number of legal concepts and institutions from Norman law were introduced to England . In the early centuries of English common law , the justices and judges were responsible for adapting the system of writs to meet everyday needs , applying a mixture of precedent and common sense to build up a body of internally consistent law . An example is the Law Merchant derived from the `` Pie - Powder '' Courts , named from a corruption of the French pieds - poudrés ( `` dusty feet '' ) implying ad hoc marketplace courts . As the Parliament of England became ever more established and influential , legislation gradually overtook judicial law - making such that today , judges are only able to innovate in certain very narrowly defined areas . In 1276 , the concept of `` time immemorial '' often applied in common law was defined as being any time before 6 July 1189 ( i.e. before Richard I 's accession to the English throne ) . Precedent ( edit ) One of the major challenges in the early centuries was to produce a system that was certain in its operation and predictable in its outcomes . Too many judges were either partial or incompetent , acquiring their positions only by virtue of their rank in society . Thus , a standardised procedure slowly emerged , based on a system termed stare decisis which roughly means `` let the decision stand '' . The doctrine of precedent which requires similar cases to be adjudicated in a like manner , falls under the principle of stare decisis . Thus , the ratio decidendi ( reason for decision ) of each case will bind future cases on the same generic set of facts both horizontally and vertically in the court structure . The highest appellate court in the UK is the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and its decisions are binding on every other court in the hierarchy which are obliged to apply its rulings as the law of the land . The Court of Appeal binds the lower courts , and so on . Overseas influences ( edit ) The influences are two - way . England exported English Common law and English Statute law to most parts of the British Empire , and many aspects of that system have survived after Independence or otherwise cessation of British rule . `` English law '' prior to the American Revolutionary Wars ( American War of Independence ) is still an influence on United States law , and provides the basis for many American legal traditions and policies . Many jurisdictions that have maintained the use of English Common law continue to incorporate modern developments of the Common law in England , and decisions from England are in many jurisdictions usually considered persuasive . The common law as taken or received from England has developed within each jurisdiction , and in that context , `` common law '' has been described as a body of judge - made law enforced and developed by the courts which includes equity and admiralty law , but has always been `` unintelligible without reference to statute '' . After the colonial period , the common law was developed within each jurisdiction under its final court of appeal : for a time in jurisdictions remaining under the British crown , it was the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council , while from the founding of the United States each state has its own supreme court with final appellate jurisdiction , and in respect of federal law the US Supreme Court has the final appellate jurisdiction . For a number of jurisdictions within the Commonwealth of Nations , the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Britain remains the ultimate court of appeal in place of a local Supreme Court . The decisions of the committee made before the change of jurisdiction remain binding legal precedent . Britain is a dualist in its relationship with international law , i.e. , international obligations have to be formally incorporated into English law before the courts are obliged to apply supranational laws . For example , the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms was signed in 1950 and Britain allowed individuals to directly petition the European Commission on Human Rights from 1966 . Now s6 ( 1 ) Human Rights Act 1998 ( HRA ) makes it unlawful `` ... for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a convention right '' , where a `` public authority '' is any person or body which exercises a public function , expressly including the courts but expressly excluding Parliament . Although the European Convention has begun to be applied to the acts of non-state agents , the HRA does not make the Convention specifically applicable between private parties . Courts have taken the Convention into account in interpreting the common law . They also must take the Convention into account in interpreting Acts of Parliament , but must ultimately follow the terms of the Act even if inconsistent with the Convention ( s3 HRA ) . Similarly , because Britain remains a strong international trading nation , international consistency of decision making is of vital importance , so Admiralty Law is strongly influenced by Public International Law and the modern commercial treaties and conventions regulating shipping . Application to Wales ( edit ) Unlike Scotland and Northern Ireland , Wales is not a separate jurisdiction within the United Kingdom . The customary laws of Wales within the Kingdom of England were abolished by King Henry VIII 's Laws in Wales Acts which brought Wales into legal conformity with England . While Wales now has a devolved Assembly , any legislation which that Assembly passes is enacted in particular circumscribed policy areas defined by the Government of Wales Act 2006 , other legislation of the British Parliament , or by Orders in Council given under the authority of the 2006 Act . Between 1746 and 1967 , any reference to England in legislation was deemed to include Wales . This ceased with the enactment of the Welsh Language Act 1967 and the jurisdiction is now commonly referred to as `` England and Wales '' . Although devolution has accorded some degree of political autonomy to Wales in the National Assembly for Wales , it did not have the ability to pass primary legislation until the Government of Wales Act 2006 came into force after the 2007 Welsh general election . That said , the Welsh legal system remains English common law , in that the legal system administered through both civil and criminal courts remains unified throughout England and Wales . This is different from the situation of Northern Ireland , for example , which did not cease to be a distinct jurisdiction when its legislature was suspended ( see Northern Ireland ( Temporary Provisions ) Act 1972 ) . A major difference is also the use of the Welsh language , as laws concerning it apply in Wales and not in the rest of the United Kingdom . The Welsh Language Act 1993 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom , which put the Welsh language on an equal footing with the English language in Wales with regard to the public sector . Welsh may also be spoken in Welsh courts .

The main elements of a crime are the actus reus ( doing something which is criminally prohibited ) and a mens rea ( having the requisite criminal state of mind , usually intention or recklessness ) . A prosecutor must show that a person has caused the offensive conduct , or that the culprit had some pre-existing duty to take steps to avoid a criminal consequence . The types of different crimes range from those well known ones like manslaughter , murder , theft and robbery to a plethora of regulatory and statutory offences . It is estimated that in the UK , there are 3,500 classes of criminal offence . Certain defences may exist to crimes , which include self - defence , intention , necessity , duress , and in the case of a murder charge , under the Homicide Act 1957 , diminished responsibility , provocation and , in very rare cases , survival of a suicide pact . It has often been suggested that England and Wales should codify its criminal law in an English Criminal Code , but there has been no overwhelming support for this in the past .

( January 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Taos County , New Mexico . Justice of the Peace Montoyo hears a minor case . ( 1941 ) A justice of the peace ( JP ) is a judicial officer , of a lower or puisne court , elected or appointed by means of a commission ( letters patent ) to keep the peace . In past centuries the term commissioner of the peace was often used with the same meaning . Depending on the jurisdiction , such justices dispense summary justice or merely deal with local administrative applications in common law jurisdictions . Justices of the peace are appointed or elected from the citizens of the jurisdiction in which they serve , and are ( or were ) usually not required to have any formal legal education in order to qualify for the office . Some jurisdictions have varying forms of training for JPs .

They were responsible to the King for ensuring that the law was upheld and preserving the `` King 's peace '' . Therefore , they were known as `` keepers of the peace '' . An act of 1327 had referred to `` good and lawful men '' to be appointed in every county in the land to `` guard the peace '' ; such individuals were first referred to as conservators of the peace , or wardens of the peace . The title justice of the peace derives from 1361 , in the reign of Edward III . The `` peace '' to be guarded is the sovereign 's , the maintenance of which is the duty of the Crown under the royal prerogative . Justices of the peace still use the power conferred or re-conferred on them since 1361 to bind over unruly persons `` to be of good behaviour '' . The bind over is not a punishment , but a preventive measure , intended to ensure that people thought likely to offend will not do so . The justices ' alternative title of `` magistrate '' dates from the 16th century , although the word had been in use centuries earlier to describe some legal officials of Roman times . In the centuries from the Tudor period until the onset of the Industrial Revolution , the JPs constituted a major element of the English ( later British ) governmental system , which had been termed sometimes squirearchy ( i.e. , dominance of the land - owning gentry ) . For example , historian Tim Blanning notes that while in Britain the royal prerogative was decisively curbed by the Bill of Rights 1689 , in practice the central government in London had a greater ability to get its policies implemented in the rural outlying regions than could contemporary absolute monarchies such as France -- a paradox due especially to JPs belonging to the same social class as the Members of Parliament and thus having a direct interest in getting laws actually enforced and implemented on the ground . Being an unpaid office , undertaken voluntarily and sometimes more for the sake of renown or to confirm the justice 's standing within the community , the justice was typically a member of the gentry . The justices of the peace conducted arraignments in all criminal cases , and tried misdemeanours and infractions of local ordinances and bylaws . Towns and boroughs with enough burdensome judicial business that could not find volunteers for the unpaid role of justice of the peace had to petition the Crown for authority to hire a paid stipendiary magistrate . The Municipal Corporations Act 1835 stripped the power to appoint normal JPs from those municipal corporations that had it . This was replaced by the present system , where the Lord Chancellor nominates candidates with local advice , for appointment by the Crown . Until the introduction of elected county councils in the 19th century , JPs , in quarter sessions , also administered the county at a local level . They fixed wages , regulated food supplies , built and controlled roads and bridges , and undertook to provide and supervise locally those services mandated by the Crown and Parliament for the welfare of the county . Women were not allowed to become JPs in the United Kingdom until 1919 , the first woman being Ada Summers , the Mayor of Stalybridge , who was a JP by virtue of her office . Emily Murphy of Edmonton , Canada , preceded her by some three and a half years . Now in the UK , 50 % of JPs are women . In special circumstances , a justice of the peace can be the highest governmental representative , so in fact ' gubernatorial ' , in a colonial entity . This was the case in the Tati Concessions Land , a gold - mining concession ( territory ) in the Matabele kingdom , until its annexation by the British Bechuanaland protectorate . See also : Magistrates ' court ( Russia ) Modern use ( edit ) Australia ( edit ) A justice of the peace in Australia is typically someone of good stature in the community who is authorised to witness and sign statutory declarations and affidavits and to certify copies of original documents . Criteria for appointment vary widely , depending on the state . For example , in Queensland , a justice of the peace ( qualified ) must complete an exam prior to being eligible for appointment , whereas in Victoria , a person need only prove good character by way of references . Queensland ( edit ) In the state of Queensland , a `` justice of the peace ( qualified ) '' has the additional powers to issue search warrants and arrest warrants and , in conjunction with another justice of the peace ( qualified ) constitute a magistrates ' court for exercising powers to remand defendants in custody , grant bail , and adjourn court hearings . Some justices are appointed as justice of the peace ( magistrates ' court ) , usually in remote aboriginal communities , to perform many of the functions that might otherwise fall to a stipendiary magistrate . In Queensland , a lawyer may be appointed as a Justice of the Peace without further education or qualification and has the full powers of a JP ( Magistrate 's Court ) . A commissioner for declarations ( C. dec ) has powers limited to witnessing documents , witnessing statutory declarations , witnessing affidavits , witnessing and administering oaths and affirmations . Victoria ( edit ) Justices of the peace and bail justices , who are also volunteers , are appointed to serve a semi-judicial function in all areas of the Victorian community . The main official roles in the Victorian community include witnessing statutory declarations , witnessing affidavits and hearing bail matters outside court hours ( bail justices only ) . Justices of the peace ( JPs ) provide a service to the community as independent witnesses of statutory declarations , powers of attorney and affidavits . JPs , who are also volunteers , are recommended by the state attorney - general and appointed by the governor - in - council , and it is their job to authorise and witness statutory declarations and affidavits within the state of Victoria . There are currently around 4,800 JPs serving in all areas of the state . Bail justices ( edit ) The role of a bail justice is to hear bail applications ( under the Bail Act 1977 ) and to hear applications for interim accommodation orders for children ( under the Children and Young Persons Act 1989 ) within Victoria . Bail justices , once appointed , may remain in their role until they turn 70 years of age ( although they must be under 65 at the time of their appointment ) . They are often required to attend call outs and rule on bail applications or protection applications for children in danger on weekends and late at night when the courts are closed , but they can also witness Victorian statutory declarations and affidavits . Candidates must successfully complete a three - day training course run by the Department of Justice . Bail justices , who are also volunteers , also have some limited powers under federal legislation , including the power to conduct interstate extradition hearings and extending question time for federal police . Bail Justices may use the post-nominals BJ after their names . New South Wales ( edit ) The most common functions performed by a justice of the peace in New South Wales are to witness the signing of a statutory declaration , witness the signing of an affidavit and certify that a copy of an original document is a true copy . JPs are appointed by the Governor of New South Wales for five - year terms . They are volunteers , who come from all walks of life and all sections of the community . JPs are people who are trusted to be honest , careful and impartial when performing the functions of a JP . They must not charge a fee or accept a gift for providing JP services , tell people what to write in a statutory declaration or affidavit or write it for them or give them legal advice . Ways to find a JP in New South Wales include : 1 . Search the JP Public Register . The register lists all JPs for each postcode area and provides a telephone contact number for JPs who serve the community directly . 2 . Check a public listing of scheduled JP services to find when JPs are available at scheduled times and locations across the state . South Australia ( edit ) In South Australia , there are two types of justices : justice of the peace and special justices . A justice of the peace ( JP ) in South Australia is typically someone of good stature in the community who is authorised to witness and sign statutory declarations , affidavits , waiver rights , search warrants , drug warrants , divorce documents , and to certify copies of original documents and to witness the signing of power of attorney and guardianship documents , providing the JP is satisfied with the capability of the signatory . A Special Justice ( SJ ) is a higher level of justice of the peace in South Australia ; they sit on the bench of the magistrates ' court hearing cases in the petty sessions division . The South Australian Attorney - General has set up a web site to locate justices of the peace . The majority of metropolitan and many regional Councils ( Local Government authorities ) have a rotational justice of the peace in residence at nominated times . Western Australia ( edit ) Justices of the peace in Western Australia are appointed by the Governor who authorises them to carry out a wide range of official administrative and judicial duties in the community . As well as presiding in the Magistrates Court , justices of the peace are regularly called upon by the WA Police to sign search warrants and authorise the issuing of summonses . The administrative tasks include witnessing affidavits and documents such as wills and statutory declarations . ' Visiting justices ' are a special group of justices of the peace , appointed to preside over cases within the prison system . Belgium ( edit ) In Belgium , the justice of the peace ( French : juge de paix , Dutch : vrederechter ) is a law - trained judge who sits the lowest Court of record with original jurisdiction over small claims ( less than € 2500 ) matters of civil , commercial , and family law , including : tenancy and lease disputes , neighborhood disputes ( party structures , trespassing , noise pollution ) , apartment buildings , small deceased estates , alimony , guardianships & adoption , and the commitment of mental patients and oversight of their care . Litigants may opt either for conciliation or trial . Lawyers may act as locum tenens JPs . Canada ( edit ) In Canada , justices of the peace play a role in the administration of justice at the provincial level . Justices are generally appointed by the lieutenant governors of Canada 's provinces , and by the commissioners of Canada 's territories , on the advice of their relevant premier or Attorney General . Canada made the first appointment in the then British Empire of a woman as a magistrate , namely Emily Murphy , who was sworn in as a police magistrate in the Women 's Court of the City of Edmonton ( Alberta ) on 19 June 1916 . British Columbia ( edit ) In British Columbia , pursuant to the Provincial Court Act , all judges are justices of the peace , and hence all of them are peace officers . Northwest Territories ( edit ) In the Northwest Territories , justices may hear summary conviction matters , municipal by - laws , and certain criminal matters . However , in more populated provinces justices usually preside over bail hearings and provincial offences courts . When not in a court session , a justice can perform other judicial functions , such as issuing search warrants . Ontario ( edit ) In Ontario , justices perform a wide variety of duties related to criminal and regulatory law , at the federal , provincial and municipal levels . Ontario JP wear a green sash versus red worn by judges . Quebec ( edit ) In Quebec , there are two type of justices of the peace , administrative justice of the peace and presiding justice of the peace . Administrative justice of the peace are court officers appointed by the Minister of Justice , and perform duties such as receiving criminal informations and issuing warrants . Presiding justice of the peace are appointed by commission under the Great Seal , and can try some criminal matters and issue warrants . They are appointed from advocates of at least ten years ' standing and serve full - time until the age of 70 . Yukon ( edit ) In Yukon , justices of the peace are lay officers of the court . They sit in the Justice of the Peace Court , which is part of the Territorial Court of Yukon . Hong Kong ( edit ) In Hong Kong , the historical functions of justices of the peace have been replaced by full - time , legally qualified magistrates . Nowadays , justices of the peace are essentially titles of honour given by the Government to community leaders , and to certain officials while they are in their terms of offices . They have no judicial functions , and their main duties include visiting prisons , institutions for young offenders and drug addicts , psychiatric hospitals , remand homes , places of refuge , reception and detention centres , administering statutory declarations , and serving as members of advisory panels . India ( edit ) In India , justices of the peace do exist , but they no longer occupy a prominent post . One of the famous justices in India was Kavasji Jamshedji Petigara . Maharaja Prabirendra Mohan Tagore son of Maharaja Sir Prodyut Kumar Tagore KCSI of Calcutta was designated Justice of the Peace in 1932 . He played a great part in saving more than 200 Muslim lives during the famous riots in 1947 during the partition of India , by sheltering the Muslims in the Calcutta locality and most importantly in his palace itself . Ireland ( edit ) Justices of the peace existed in Ireland prior to 1922 , sitting in a bench under the supervision of resident magistrates at petty sessions to try minor offences summarily , and with a county court judge ( in his capacity of chairman of quarter sessions ) and jury to try more serious offences at quarter sessions . In the Irish Free State the position was effectively abolished by the District Justices ( Temporary Provisions ) Act 1923 and permanently abolished by the Courts of Justice Act 1924 . Their judicial powers were replaced by full - time , legally qualified district justices ( now called district judges ) and their quasi-judicial powers by lay Peace Commissioners . Peace commissioners may sign statutory declarations , and may issue summons and search warrants to the Garda Síochána ( Irish police ) . A Peace Commissioner can not sign an Affidavit , in Ireland that function is performed by a Commissioner for Oaths . Jamaica ( edit ) A justice of the peace ( JP ) , according to the Ministry of Justice , is a person of unquestionable integrity who seeks to promote and protect the rights of the individual and helps to provide justice to persons in a particular community . Additionally , the JP serves as a justice in petty court sessions , attends juvenile court sessions , issues summonses , considers applications for bail , explains and signs legal documents , sits on licensing panels , and gives counsel / advice . Any Jamaican citizen that can speak and write English is eligible to become a JP . Any club / organisation / citizen can recommend someone to become JP for a community . JPs are chosen under the Governor - General 's discretion . Malaysia ( edit ) In Malaysia , justices of the peace have largely been replaced in magistrates ' courts by legally qualified ( first - class ) stipendiary magistrates . However , state governments continue to appoint justices of the peace as honours . In 2004 , some associations of justices of the peace pressed the federal government to allow justices of the peace to sit as second - class magistrates in order to reduce the backlog of cases in the courts . New Zealand ( edit ) A Justice of the Peace in New Zealand is someone of good stature in the community who is authorized to witness and sign statutory declarations and affidavits as well as certify documents . They may also perform citizenship ceremonies and act as a Visiting Justice in prisons the function of which is to record a prisoner 's grievance and decide on its validity . They have certain powers to issue search warrants , and ( in conjunction with another justice of the peace ) may try minor criminal trials in the district court and exercise powers to remand defendants in custody , grant bail , and adjourn court hearings . They are nominated for office by local Members of Parliament and appointed by the Governor General . Appointment is for life and a JP must take the Oath of Allegiance and the Judicial Oath . Pakistan ( edit ) Sections 22 , 22 - A and 22 - B of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code , 1898 provide for the appointment of justices of the peace by the provincial governments , their powers and duties respectively . However , seldom are justices of the peace appointed in Pakistan outside the judiciary . Session and additional session judges act as ex-officio justices of the peace as per Section 25 of the Code of Criminal Procedure , 1898 . An Ex-officio Justice of the Peace may issue appropriate directions to the police authorities concerned on a complaint regarding - ( i ) non-registration of a criminal case ; ( ii ) transfer of investigation from one police officer to another ; and ( iii ) neglect , failure or excess committed by a police authority in relation to its functions and duties . Such functions being quasi-judicial in nature could not be termed as executive , administrative or ministerial. ( PLD 2016 Supreme Court 581 ) It is pertinent to note however , as many academics have pointed out , that there is great utility in the appointment of such justices especially in rural areas where enmity between rival groups can lead to the inability of registration of cognizable offences and biased judicial proceedings . Singapore ( edit ) A justice of the peace in Singapore derives his powers from statute law . He is appointed by the President of the Republic of Singapore , under the provisions of section 11 ( l ) of the Subordinate Courts Act ( Cap. 321 ) . The President may revoke the appointment of any justice of the peace . A newly appointed justice of the peace is required by section 17 of the Subordinate Courts Act , to take the oath of office and allegiance as set out in the schedule to the Subordinate Courts Act , before exercising the functions of his office . In their role , JPs serve as visiting justices of Singapore prisons , mediators or referees in the subordinate courts . They may also solemnise marriages in the Registry of Marriages or perform the duties of the magistrate conferred on them by any written law . Sri Lanka ( edit ) In Sri Lanka , Justice of the Peace ( JP ) is an honorary post , with authorization to witness and sign statutory declarations and affidavits . Persons appointed as a Justice of the Peace may use the post-nominal JP . Current appointments are made under the Judicature Act No 02 of 1978 , by the Minister of Justice at his / her discretion by publishing a list in the Gazette and appointee taking oaths before a high court , district court judge or magistrate with registrar of the supreme court recording it . Any citizen of Sri Lanka can apply to the Ministry of Justice giving his or her credentials to be appointed as a justice of the peace . However , the applicant should be one who has served the public and carries out social service and should be of good standing . The President of Sri Lanka and his / her officers are ex officio justices of the peace . A justice of the peace , who is an Attorney at law can be appointed as an unofficial magistrate . The post was introduced in the British colonial era , during which time appointments were made by the Governor until 1938 , after which appointments were made by the Legal Secretary until 1947 . After Ceylon gained its independence in 1948 , appointments were made by the Governor General and the Minister of Justice . Justice of the Peace had the power to administer oaths and affirmations per the Courts Ordinance No. 1 on 1889 section 84 and they could formally appoint members of the public to act as special police officers in times of turmoil and riots . Since certain government officers were ex-officio justices of the peace , this allowed British colonial officers to appoint special police officers from the European planters in times of crisies such as the 1915 riots . The Village Councils Law ( No. 6 of 1964 ) made the Chairman of the Village Council an ex officio justices of the peace for that village area . Tonga ( edit ) In 2014 , for the first time , Justices of the Peace were authorized in Tonga . JPs are appointed by the Crown , but the Lord Chief Justice regulates their duties and defines their powers . The first JPs were warranted with duties including granting bail ; issuing search warrants and subpoenas ; taking affidavits , declarations and oaths ; and having the power to witness documents .

They are advised on points of law and procedure by a legally qualified justices ' clerk and their assistants . No formal qualifications are required but magistrates need intelligence , common sense , integrity and the capacity to act fairly . Membership is widely spread throughout the local area and drawn from all walks of life . All magistrates are carefully trained before sitting and continue to receive training throughout their service . Magistrates are unpaid volunteers but they may receive allowances to cover travelling expenses and subsistence . Lay justices or magistrates must sit for a minimum of 26 sessions ( half - days ) per year , but some sit as much as a day a week , or possibly more . In addition to the lay justices , there are a small number of district judges , formerly known as stipendiary magistrates . These are legally qualified , full - time members of the magistracy and hear cases alone , without any other magistrates on the bench . It is important to distinguish the district judge ( magistrates ' court ) from the district judges who usually sit in the county court . Magistrates ' courts today can deal with minor offences ( fines of up to £ 5,000 , or imprisonment of up to six months for a single offence or 12 months for consecutive sentences , or both ) and handle over 95 % of the criminal cases in England and Wales and Northern Ireland . With more serious offences , magistrates are responsible for indictment and committal to the Crown Court ( a task in former times dealt with by a grand jury ) . Magistrates also have a civil jurisdiction , such as a family jurisdiction . Although they had a licensing jurisdiction dealing liquor , betting and clubs licensing applications , this was transferred under the Licensing Act 2003 to local authorities . The magistrates now act in licensing matters only as an appeal court from the decisions of the local authority . Cardiff Magistrates ' Court is the only court in the country which deals with offences under the Companies Act , such as for late filing of accounts or directors ' offences . Westminster Magistrates ' Court has special responsibilities for dealing with all terrorism and extradition offences throughout the UK . Until the Courts Act 2003 came into force , magistrates were tied to a particular area ( see magistrates ' courts committee , commission area , petty sessions area ) . This has now been changed such that they are assigned to local justice areas , but less strongly . The Courts Act provides the current framework for appointment of the justices , which is done by the Lord Chancellor in the name of sovereign . Justices can also be removed by the same mechanism . District judges ( magistrates ' court ) -- previously known as stipendiary magistrates -- must have a seven years ' general legal qualification , and are appointed by the sovereign on the advice of the Lord Chancellor . Before 1714 , magistrates were liable to be approached at any time and in any place by people legally recognised as paupers , appealing for aid if parish authorities refused to provide any . It was relatively common for these magistrates to write out , on the spot , an order requiring aid to be granted . Scotland ( edit ) See also : Judiciary of Scotland Within the Scottish legal system justices of the peace are lay magistrates who currently sit in the justice of the peace courts . These courts were introduced in 2009 as a replacement for the district courts ( established in 1975 ) , which in turn replaced burgh police courts . Justices sit alone or in threes with a qualified legal assessor as convener or clerk of court . They handle many cases of breaches of the peace , drunkenness , minor assaults , petty theft , and offences under the Civic Government ( Scotland ) Act 1982 . The maximum sentencing power of a justice of the peace is 60 days imprisonment , or a fine up to £ 2,500 , or both , and the ability to disqualify drivers . In 2006 , the Scottish Government announced its intention to unify the management of the sheriff and district courts in Scotland , but retaining lay justices , as part of its initiative to create a unified judiciary under the Lord President . Following the passage of the Criminal Proceedings etc . ( Reform ) ( Scotland ) Act 2007 the justice of the peace courts were implemented on a sheriffdom - by - sheriffdom basis . In Glasgow , the volume of business required the employment of three solicitors as `` stipendiary magistrates '' who sat in place of the lay justices . The stipendiary magistrates ' court had the same sentencing power as the summary sheriff court in summary proceedings , which was the ability to sentence an offender to up to 1 year in prison or fine them up to £ 10,000 . Stipendiary magistrates were replaced by summary sheriffs . Northern Ireland ( edit ) In Northern Ireland , the situation initially continued as it had in pre-1922 Ireland . However , justices of the peace no longer sat out of petty sessions after 1935 ( Summary Jurisdiction and Criminal Justice Act ( Northern Ireland ) 1935 ) . Since then , magistrates ' courts in Northern Ireland have consisted of legally qualified resident magistrates ( now known as district judges ( magistrates ' courts ) ) sitting alone , except in cases involving children , where two lay panelists sat with the magistrate . Justices of the peace were confined to the power to conduct committal hearings , bind persons over to the peace , sign warrants , summons , and other official documents . They were appointed by the Lord Chancellor on the recommendation of a committee in each county court division . The Justice ( Northern Ireland ) Act 2002 introduced a new office of lay magistrate , to sit alongside resident magistrates at magistrates ' courts in certain matters . Unlike in England and Wales , `` lay magistrate '' is the official title of the position , to distinguish from existing justices of the peace who do not sit in the magistrates ' courts . The first lay magistrates were appointed in 2005 . Two lay magistrates sit with the district judge ( magistrates ' court ) in criminal proceedings involving children ( replacing the former lay panelists ) and Family Proceedings Court matters . The district judge ( magistrates ' court ) , who is a barrister or solicitor of at least seven years standing , presides over the bench . Most criminal justice functions of JPs were transferred to lay magistrates . It is expected that there will be no further appointments of justices of the peace in Northern Ireland , although those already appointed retain the title and any functions not transferred to lay magistrate under the 2002 Act . United states ( edit ) In some US states , the justice of the peace is a judge of a court of limited jurisdiction , a magistrate , or a quasi-judicial official with certain statutory or common law magisterial powers . Some states have special qualifications or unique features for the office . The justice of the peace typically presides over a court that hears misdemeanor cases , traffic violations , and other petty criminal infractions . The justice of the peace may also have authority over cases involving small debts , landlord and tenant disputes , or other small claims court proceedings . Proceedings before justices of the peace are often faster and less formal than the proceedings in other courts . In some jurisdictions a party convicted or found liable before a justice of the peace may have the right to a trial de novo before the judge of a higher court rather than an appeal strictly considered . A justice of the peace also performs civil marriages . Arizona ( edit ) A justice of the peace has the same jurisdiction as a municipal magistrate with respect to traffic and misdemeanor cases and restraining orders , though over cases whose affairs are not contained within the confines of a single municipality . Additionally , the Justice Court hears cases involving county ordinances ( ordinances enacted by the board of supervisors that apply only to unincorporated areas ) , civil lawsuits up to a limit of $10,000 , small claims cases up to $2,500 , and issues evictions , called writs of restitution ( after a forcible detainer or special detainer action ( eviction ) being successfully completed by a landlord ) . Justices of the peace , also called JPs , or Judges of the Justice Court , are elected in partisan elections for four - year terms from specific districts called precincts . They have the same authority and responsibility as all other judges in the state with respect to performing marriages , administrating oaths , adhering to the code of judicial conduct , and all aspects of justice administration . However , Arizona law does not require justices of the peace to be lawyers . Many justices of the peace are not legally trained , although all are required by the Arizona Supreme Court to complete a course at the Arizona Judicial College . As with JPs , municipal judges in Arizona are not required to be lawyers . Arkansas ( edit ) This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( April 2013 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) In Arkansas , a justice of the peace is an elected official equivalent to a county commissioner or county supervisor in some other states . Arkansas JPs sit on a county quorum court , composed of 9 , 11 , 13 or 15 JPs . The quorum court is a part - time body , elected from single - member districts , that has overall responsibility for county affairs . Among their responsibilities are passing the budget , creating new ordinances ( at the misdemeanor level ) , setting property tax millage levels , and working with other elected officials . The full - time elected county administrator , who presides over the quorum court , is the county judge . Neither JPs nor the county judge have any judicial authority , though they do have the power to preside over civil marriages . Justices of the peace are elected every two years to these partisan offices . Massachusetts , Connecticut , Vermont ( edit ) Justices of the peace in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are often called on to perform marriages and , especially same - sex marriages , which certain religious officials are not willing to oversee . Justices of the peace in Connecticut can preside over same - sex marriages . Unlike Massachusetts , Connecticut JPs are not penalized for refusing to perform such ceremonies . Justices of the peace in Connecticut , Massachusetts , and Vermont have the same general oath - giving powers as a notary public . Louisiana Are elected to serve six year terms as the judicial authority of a ward or district . Have jurisdiction in civil matters when the amount in dispute does not exceed $5,000 . Do not have jurisdiction when a title to real estate is involved , when the state or any political subdivision is a defendant , or in successions or probate matters . Can perform marriage ceremonies Minnesota ( edit ) In Minnesota , the history of justices of the peace dates back hundreds of years to a time when they were considered to be some of the most powerful officials in terms of the authority that they had to influence change in a community . In modern times though , official justices of the peace are no longer present in Minnesota , but because of their history many current officials are still referred to as justices of the peace by a vast majority of Minnesotans . For example , while the authority to perform marriages in Minnesota was once reserved almost exclusively for justices of the peace , today that authority now lies with officials such as judges , court administrators , and ordained wedding officiants Nevertheless , it remains commonplace throughout the state for each of these types of officials to be referred to as a justice of the peace in the context of marriage . Another example of a current official who is often referred to as a justice of the peace is a notary public . Their responsibilities are largely related to acting as an official witness to an event , such as the signing of an important document , which is a responsibility that was once reserved for a justice of the peace . So while justices of the peace no longer exist in Minnesota in any official capacity , there are certainly some officials who can relate to being referred to as a justice of the peace simply due to the functions they perform . New York ( edit ) Justice courts are courts in New York State that handle traffic tickets , criminal matters , small claims and local code violations such as zoning . Though justice courts constitutionally are part of the New York State Unified Court System , state law generally makes justice courts independent of New York 's Office of Court Administration ( OCA ) and instead makes Justice Courts the responsibility of their sponsoring localities . Town justice courts are often called Town Court , and village justice courts are often called Village Court . City courts in New York State handle mostly the same types of cases but are not justice courts . The official title for judges in Justice Courts is Justice , the same as in New York Supreme Court . However , in common usage , most people , including lawyers , call them Judge . Justices in Justice Court do not have to be lawyers . The vast majority are not . Many of these courts are in small towns and villages where none of the residents are lawyers . In the larger towns , the justices are almost always lawyers . While Justices and their court clerks receive training from OCA , there is tremendous variability in how cases are handled . This includes court procedures and substantive results . Some courts will dismiss a traffic ticket if the officer does not appear for a trial , while others will adjourn the matter to give the officer another chance . In some courts the police prosecute their own tickets , while in others an Assistant District Attorney from the county or a town or village attorney will prosecute the tickets . This may even vary by the type of officer , with State Troopers and Deputies prosecuting their tickets and a town attorney prosecuting tickets written by the town police . Larger towns can have very busy caseloads , including several sessions a week with dozens of cases at each session , and people may have to wait hours before their cases are heard . In some small towns the caseload is extremely light , and a court might meet once a month and have only a few cases . All criminal prosecutions that occur in towns and villages are commenced in a justice court . Misdemeanors are handled exclusively in the justice court , while felonies generally move up to County Court before the case moves forward . Similar matters in some places outside New York are handled by a justice of the peace . New Hampshire ( edit ) New Hampshire justices of the peace are commissioned magisterial officers , appointed by the Governor and Executive Council to terms of five years , with the power to administer oaths , acknowledge instruments , perform marriage ceremonies and , effective January 1 , 2008 , solemnize civil unions for same - sex couples . They may also order compulsory mental examinations for good cause , act as a magisterial official regarding enforcement complaints on orders for isolation or quarantine issued by the Commissioner of Health and Human Services , administer oaths of office to public officials , take depositions and issue subpoenas . New Hampshire justices of the peace are also authorized , upon a showing of probable cause supported by affidavit , to issue arrest warrants , search warrants , administrative inspection warrants and by court appointment , to fix and receive bail in criminal cases . Texas ( edit ) In Texas , JP 's are elected on a partisan ballot every four years . Texas does not require a JP to be an attorney in good standing . However , JP 's are required to be `` well versed in the law '' and take mandatory classes to retain their office . New JP 's are required to take 80 hours of legal state mandated classes the first year , and 20 hours each year thereafter during their tenure in office . Sections 18 and 19 of Article V of the Texas Constitution , as well as Chapters 27 and 28 of the Texas Government Code , outline the duties of these Courts and their officers . Under Section 18 , the number of JP 's ( and associated constables ) is dependent on the size of the county : For counties with populations less than 18,000 ( as determined by the census ) , the entire county shall be one JP precinct , unless the Commissioners ' Court determines that more are needed , in which case the court can divide the county into no more than four JP precincts . For counties with populations at least 18,000 but less than 50,000 , the number of JP precincts shall be no less than two nor more than eight . For counties with populations 50,000 or greater , the number of JP precincts shall be no less than four nor more than eight . In any county with population less than 150,000 , if any precinct contains a city with 18,000 or more population , that precinct shall have two JP 's . In any county with population 150,000 or greater , each JP precinct may have more than one JP . Special provisions apply to Chambers and Randall counties ( must have no fewer than two nor more than six precincts ) and to Mills , Reagan , and Roberts ( the Constable office is abolished , with the Sheriff 's office performing all duties ) . Section 19 sets forth the minimum jurisdiction of the JP court : Original jurisdiction in `` criminal matters of misdemeanor cases punishable by fine only '' ( under the Texas Penal Code such offenses are called `` Class C '' misdemeanors , generally involving traffic offenses or public intoxication ; however , in jurisdictions with a municipal court , if the traffic offense is written by a municipal police officer the municipal court will have jurisdiction , whereas if the offense is written by a state or county officer the JP court will hear the case ) , Exclusive jurisdiction in `` civil matters where the amount in controversy is $200 or less '' , and `` Such other jurisdiction as may be provided by law '' . Under this provision , the Legislature has raised the top limit on civil matters to $10,000 and assigned the JP courts , among others , the right to hear cases involving eviction as well as cases involving foreclosure and liens against personal property where the amount falls within the ( revised ) JP Court 's jurisdiction . JP cases are appealed to the county court level ; the appeal results in a trial de novo . In criminal cases , cases beginning in justice court can not be appealed beyond the county level court unless the fine is more than $100 or a constitutional matter is asserted . In smaller counties without a coroner , the JP has the duty to perform inquests . The JP is also called out for any unattended deaths in the county . A JP in a large precinct in a large county will work 5 days a week , 8 or more hours daily . Their duties will include , but are not necessarily limited to the following : Trials of civil matters , both to a 6 - person jury and to the bench , with an amount in controversy not exceeding $10,000.00 . Trials of criminal matters involving traffic violations and class C misdemeanors punishable by fine only . Pre-trial motion dockets and show cause hearings are held , and all discovery must be approved by the Judge in advance in civil cases . All criminal matters are controlled by the rules of criminal procedure and evidence . A much more restricted and smaller set of rules apply in civil matters unless in the Judges discretion , it is believed to be in the best interests of justice to apply the standard rules of evidence and procedure . The court has the exclusive jurisdiction of evictions . A Texas JP Judge will also magistrate prisoners and set bail . The Judge will hear juvenile violations such as truancy , and underage drinking and smoking . Warrants of Arrest , Alias , Search and Capias Profine are issued . Protective Orders can issue and result in jail time if violated . Several administrative matters are heard including the finding of a Dangerous Dog , Occupational Drivers License and tow hearings . Many writs are issued such as writs of re-entry to apartments , possession of realty and to reinstate utilities a landlord may have turned off . A JP has contempt power of $100 and up to 3 days in jail per occurrence . A JP is also authorized to perform marriage ceremonies . Replacement with other courts ( edit ) In many states , the office of justice of the peace has been abolished or transferred to another court , such as the magistrate court . In larger cities , cases may be heard in a municipal court which has jurisdiction only within that city . Most efforts to abolish the office of justice of the peace have been led by the American Bar Association , which views non-lawyer judges as no longer necessary , as there are now far more persons with formal legal education than in the past when justices of the peace were first used . California formerly had justice of the peace courts staffed by lay judges , but began phasing them out after a landmark 1974 decision in which the Supreme Court of California unanimously held that it was a violation of federal due process ( under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution ) to allow a non-lawyer to preside over a criminal trial which could result in incarceration of the defendant . The court specifically recognized that in the aftermath of Gideon v. Wainwright ( 1963 ) , it made no sense to allow a case to be tried before a layperson incapable of understanding the legal arguments of the attorney to whom the defendant was entitled under Gideon . The remaining justice courts ( as well as municipal courts ) were eliminated by the passage of Proposition 220 in June 1998 , which merged all lower courts within the state judicial branch into the superior courts ( the courts of general jurisdiction ) . Under current California law , all California judges must be licensed attorneys . Notably , the Supreme Court of the United States sharply disagreed with California 's analysis of the Fourteenth Amendment in the landmark case of North v. Russell , 427 U.S. 328 ( 1976 ) , in which the court held that Kentucky 's use of nonlawyer judges in its police courts was not a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees of due process and equal protection of the laws .

            "Document Text: Common law - wikipedia Common law Not to be confused with Jus commune . In law , common law ( also known as judicial precedent or judge - made law , or case law ) is that body of law derived from judicial decisions of courts and similar tribunals . The defining characteristic of `` common law '' is that it arises as precedent . In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is , a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts , and synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts . If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past , the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision ( a principle known as stare decisis ) . If , however , the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases ( called a `` matter of first impression '' ) , and legislative statutes are either silent or ambiguous on the question , judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue ( one party or the other has to win , and on disagreements of law , judges make that decision ) . The court states an opinion that gives reasons for the decision , and those reasons agglomerate with past decisions as precedent to bind future judges and litigants . Common law , as the body of law made by judges , stands in contrast to and on equal footing with statutes which are adopted through the legislative process , and regulations which are promulgated by the executive branch ( the interactions are explained later in this article ) . Stare decisis , the principle that cases should be decided according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar results , lies at the heart of all common law systems . Legal systems of the world . Common law countries are shaded ( darker ) pink . The common law -- so named because it was `` common '' to all the king 's courts across England -- originated in the practices of the courts of the English kings in the centuries following the Norman Conquest in 1066 . The British Empire spread its legal system to its historical colonies , many of which retain the common law system today . These `` common law systems '' are legal systems that give great precedential weight to common law , and to the style of reasoning inherited from the English legal system . Today , one - third of the world 's population lives in common law jurisdictions or in systems mixed with civil law , including Antigua and Barbuda , Australia , Bahamas , Bangladesh , Barbados , Belize , Botswana , Burma , Cameroon , Canada ( both the federal system and all its provinces except Quebec ) , Cyprus , Dominica , Fiji , Ghana , Grenada , Guyana , Hong Kong , India , Ireland , Israel , Jamaica , Kenya , Liberia , Malaysia , Marshall Islands , Micronesia , Namibia , Nauru , New Zealand , Nigeria , Pakistan , Palau , Papua New Guinea , Sierra Leone , Singapore , South Africa , Sri Lanka , Trinidad and Tobago , the United Kingdom ( including its overseas territories such as Gibraltar ) , the United States ( both the federal system and 49 of its 50 states ) , and Zimbabwe . Some of these countries have variants on common law systems .

The first three set out here are the most - common usages within the legal community . Other connotations from past centuries are sometimes seen , and are sometimes heard in everyday speech . Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law ( edit ) The first definition of `` common law '' given in Black 's Law Dictionary , 10th edition , 2014 , is `` The body of law derived from judicial decisions , rather than from statutes or constitutions ; ( synonym ) CASELAW , ( contrast ) STATUTORY LAW . '' This usage is given as the first definition in modern legal dictionaries , is characterized as the `` most common '' usage among legal professionals , and is the usage frequently seen in decisions of courts . In this connotation , `` common law '' distinguishes the authority that promulgated a law . For example , the law in most Anglo - American jurisdictions includes `` statutory law '' enacted by a legislature , `` regulatory law '' ( in the U.S. ) or `` delegated legislation '' ( in the U.K. ) promulgated by executive branch agencies pursuant to delegation of rule - making authority from the legislature , and common law or `` case law '' , i.e. , decisions issued by courts ( or quasi-judicial tribunals within agencies ) . This first connotation can be further differentiated into ( a ) pure common law arising from the traditional and inherent authority of courts to define what the law is , even in the absence of an underlying statute or regulation . Examples include most criminal law and procedural law before the 20th century , and even today , most contract law and the law of torts . ( b ) interstitial common law court decisions that analyze , interpret and determine the fine boundaries and distinctions in law promulgated by other bodies . This body of common law , sometimes called `` interstitial common law '' , includes judicial interpretation of the Constitution , of legislative statutes , and of agency regulations , and the application of law to specific facts . Publication of decisions , and indexing , is essential to the development of common law , and thus governments and private publishers publish law reports . While all decisions in common law jurisdictions are precedent ( at varying levels and scope as discussed throughout the article on precedent ) , some become `` leading cases '' or `` landmark decisions '' that are cited especially often . Common law legal systems as opposed to civil law legal systems ( edit ) Black 's Law Dictionary 10th Ed. , definition 2 , differentiates `` common law '' jurisdictions and legal systems from `` civil law '' or `` code '' jurisdictions . Common law systems place great weight on court decisions , which are considered `` law '' with the same force of law as statutes -- for nearly a millennium , common law courts have had the authority to make law where no legislative statute exists , and statutes mean what courts interpret them to mean . By contrast , in civil law jurisdictions ( the legal tradition that prevails , or is combined with common law , in Europe and most non-Islamic , non-common law countries ) , courts lack authority to act if there is no statute . Civil law judges tend to give less weight to judicial precedent , which means that a civil law judge deciding a given case has more freedom to interpret the text of a statute independently ( compared to a common law judge in the same circumstances ) , and therefore less predictably . For example , the Napoleonic code expressly forbade French judges to pronounce general principles of law . The role of providing overarching principles , which in common law jurisdictions is provided in judicial opinions , in civil law jurisdictions is filled by giving greater weight to scholarly literature , as explained below . Common law systems trace their history to England , while civil law systems trace their history through the Napoleonic Code back to the Corpus Juris Civilis of Roman law . Law as opposed to equity ( edit ) Black 's Law Dictionary 10th Ed. , definition 4 , differentiates `` common law '' ( or just `` law '' ) from `` equity '' . Before 1873 , England had two complementary court systems : courts of `` law '' which could only award money damages and recognized only the legal owner of property , and courts of `` equity '' ( courts of chancery ) that could issue injunctive relief ( that is , a court order to a party to do something , give something to someone , or stop doing something ) and recognized trusts of property . This split propagated to many of the colonies , including the United States . For most purposes , most jurisdictions , including the U.S. federal system and most states , have merged the two courts . Additionally , even before the separate courts were merged , most courts were permitted to apply both law and equity , though under potentially different procedural law . Nonetheless , the historical distinction between `` law '' and `` equity '' remains important today when the case involves issues such as the following : categorizing and prioritizing rights to property -- for example , the same article of property often has a `` legal title '' and an `` equitable title '' , and these two groups of ownership rights may be held by different people . in the United States , determining whether the Seventh Amendment 's right to a jury trial applies ( a determination of a fact necessary to resolution of a `` common law '' claim ) vs. whether the issue will be decided by a judge ( issues of what the law is , and all issues relating to equity ) . the standard of review and degree of deference given by an appellate tribunal to the decision of the lower tribunal under review ( issues of law are reviewed de novo , that is , `` as if new '' from scratch by the appellate tribunal , while most issues of equity are reviewed for `` abuse of discretion '' , that is , with great deference to the tribunal below ) . the remedies available and rules of procedure to be applied . Courts of equity rely on common law principles of binding precedent . Archaic meanings and historical uses ( edit ) In addition , there are several historical ( but now archaic ) uses of the term that , while no longer current , provide background context that assists in understanding the meaning of `` common law '' today . In one usage that is now archaic , but that gives insight into the history of the common law , `` common law '' referred to the pre-Christian system of law , imported by the Saxons to England , and dating to before the Norman conquest , and before there was any consistent law to be applied . That usage is obsolete today . It is both underinclusive and overinclusive , as discussed in the section on `` misconceptions '' . `` Common law '' as the term is used today in common law countries contrasts with ius commune . While historically the ius commune became a secure point of reference in continental European legal systems , in England it was not a point of reference at all . The English Court of Common Pleas dealt with lawsuits in which the Monarch had no interest , i.e. , between commoners . Black 's Law Dictionary 10th Ed. , definition 3 is `` General law common to a country as a whole , as opposed to special law that has only local application . '' From at least the 11th century and continuing for several centuries after that , there were several different circuits in the royal court system , served by itinerant judges who would travel from town to town dispensing the King 's justice in `` assizes '' . The term `` common law '' was used to describe the law held in common between the circuits and the different stops in each circuit . The more widely a particular law was recognized , the more weight it held , whereas purely local customs were generally subordinate to law recognized in a plurality of jurisdictions . Misconceptions and imprecise non-lawyer usages ( edit ) A number of misconceptions of the term `` common law '' exist in popular culture and non-lawyer sources . Under the modern view , `` common law '' is not grounded in `` custom '' or `` ancient usage '' , but rather acquires force of law instantly ( without the delay implied by the term `` custom '' or `` ancient '' ) when pronounced by a higher court , because and to the extent the proposition is stated in judicial opinion . From the earliest times through the late 19th century , the dominant theory was that the common law was a pre-existent law or system of rules , a social standard of justice that existed in the habits , customs , and thoughts of the people . Under this older view , the legal profession considered it no part of a judge 's duty to make new or change existing law , but only to expound and apply the old . By the early 20th century , largely at the urging of Oliver Wendell Holmes ( as discussed throughout this article ) , this view had fallen into the minority view : Holmes pointed out that the older view worked undesirable and unjust results , and hampered a proper development of the law . In the century since Holmes , the dominant understanding has been that common law `` decisions are themselves law , or rather the rules which the courts lay down in making the decisions constitute law '' . The reality of the modern view can be seen in practical operation : under the old `` pre-existing custom '' view , ( a ) jurisdictions could not logically diverge from each other ( but nonetheless did ) , ( b ) a new decision logically needed to operate retroactively ( but did not ) , and ( c ) there was no standard to decide which English medieval customs should be `` law '' and which should not . All three tensions resolve under the modern view : ( a ) the common law in different jurisdictions may diverge , ( b ) new decisions need not have retroactive operation , and ( c ) court decisions are effective immediately as they are issued , not years later , or after they become `` custom '' , and questions of what `` custom '' might have been at some `` ancient '' time are simply irrelevant . Common law , as the term is used among lawyers in the present day , is not frozen in time , and no longer beholden to 11th , 13th , or 17th century English law . Rather , the common law evolves daily and immediately as courts issue precedential decisions ( as explained later in this article ) , and all parties in the legal system ( courts , lawyers , and all others ) are responsible for up - to - date knowledge . There is no fixed reference point ( for example the 11th or 18th centuries ) for the definition of `` common law '' , except in a handful of isolated contexts . Much of what was `` customary '' in the 13th or 17th or 18th century has no part of the common law today ; much of the common law today has no antecedent in those earlier centuries . Among legal professionals ( lawyers and judges ) , the change in understanding occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries ( as explained later in this article ) , though lay dictionaries were decades behind in recognizing the change . The common law is not `` unwritten '' . Common law exists in writing -- as must any law that is to be applied consistently -- in the written decisions of judges . Common law is not the product of `` universal consent '' . Rather , the common law is often anti-majoritarian . Basic principles of common law ( edit ) Common law adjudication ( edit ) In a common law jurisdiction several stages of research and analysis are required to determine `` what the law is '' in a given situation . First , one must ascertain the facts . Then , one must locate any relevant statutes and cases . Then one must extract the principles , analogies and statements by various courts of what they consider important to determine how the next court is likely to rule on the facts of the present case . Later decisions , and decisions of higher courts or legislatures carry more weight than earlier cases and those of lower courts . Finally , one integrates all the lines drawn and reasons given , and determines `` what the law is '' . Then , one applies that law to the facts . In practice , common law systems are considerably more complicated than the simplified system described above . The decisions of a court are binding only in a particular jurisdiction , and even within a given jurisdiction , some courts have more power than others . For example , in most jurisdictions , decisions by appellate courts are binding on lower courts in the same jurisdiction , and on future decisions of the same appellate court , but decisions of lower courts are only non-binding persuasive authority . Interactions between common law , constitutional law , statutory law and regulatory law also give rise to considerable complexity . The common law evolves to meet changing social needs and improved understanding ( edit ) Nomination of Oliver Wendell Holmes to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court , 1902 . Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr. cautioned that `` the proper derivation of general principles in both common and constitutional law ... arise gradually , in the emergence of a consensus from a multitude of particularized prior decisions . '' Justice Cardozo noted the `` common law does not work from pre-established truths of universal and inflexible validity to conclusions derived from them deductively '' , but `` ( i ) ts method is inductive , and it draws its generalizations from particulars '' . The common law is more malleable than statutory law . First , common law courts are not absolutely bound by precedent , but can ( when extraordinarily good reason is shown ) reinterpret and revise the law , without legislative intervention , to adapt to new trends in political , legal and social philosophy . Second , the common law evolves through a series of gradual steps , that gradually works out all the details , so that over a decade or more , the law can change substantially but without a sharp break , thereby reducing disruptive effects . In contrast to common law incrementalism , the legislative process is very difficult to get started , as legislatures tend to delay action until a situation is totally intolerable . For these reasons , legislative changes tend to be large , jarring and disruptive ( sometimes positively , sometimes negatively , and sometimes with unintended consequences ) . One example of the gradual change that typifies evolution of the common law is the gradual change in liability for negligence . The traditional common law rule through most of the 19th century was that a plaintiff could not recover for a defendant 's negligent production or distribution of a harmful instrumentality unless the two were in privity of contract . Thus , only the immediate purchaser could recover for a product defect , and if a part was built up out of parts from parts manufacturers , the ultimate buyer could not recover for injury caused by a defect in the part . In an 1842 English case , Winterbottom v. Wright , the postal service had contracted with Wright to maintain its coaches . Winterbottom was a driver for the post . When the coach failed and injured Winterbottom , he sued Wright . The Winterbottom court recognized that there would be `` absurd and outrageous consequences '' if an injured person could sue any person peripherally involved , and knew it had to draw a line somewhere , a limit on the causal connection between the negligent conduct and the injury . The court looked to the contractual relationships , and held that liability would only flow as far as the person in immediate contract ( `` privity '' ) with the negligent party . A first exception to this rule arose in 1852 , in the case of Thomas v. Winchester , when New York 's highest court held that mislabeling a poison as an innocuous herb , and then selling the mislabeled poison through a dealer who would be expected to resell it , put `` human life in imminent danger '' . Thomas relied on this reason to create an exception to the `` privity '' rule . In , 1909 , New York held in Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co. that a coffee urn manufacturer was liable to a person injured when the urn exploded , because the urn `` was of such a character inherently that , when applied to the purposes for which it was designed , it was liable to become a source of great danger to many people if not carefully and properly constructed '' . Yet the privity rule survived . In Cadillac Motor Car Co. v. Johnson , ( decided in 1915 by the federal appeals court for New York and several neighboring states ) , the court held that a car owner could not recover for injuries from a defective wheel , when the automobile owner had a contract only with the automobile dealer and not with the manufacturer , even though there was `` no question that the wheel was made of dead and ' dozy ' wood , quite insufficient for its purposes . '' The Cadillac court was willing to acknowledge that the case law supported exceptions for `` an article dangerous in its nature or likely to become so in the course of the ordinary usage to be contemplated by the vendor '' . However , held the Cadillac court , `` one who manufactures articles dangerous only if defectively made , or installed , e.g. , tables , chairs , pictures or mirrors hung on the walls , carriages , automobiles , and so on , is not liable to third parties for injuries caused by them , except in case of willful injury or fraud , '' Nomination of Benjamin Cardozo to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court , 1932 . Finally , in the famous case of MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co. , in 1916 , Judge Benjamin Cardozo for New York 's highest court pulled a broader principle out of these predecessor cases . The facts were almost identical to Cadillac a year earlier : a wheel from a wheel manufacturer was sold to Buick , to a dealer , to MacPherson , and the wheel failed , injuring MacPherson . Judge Cardozo held : It may be that Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co. have extended the rule of Thomas v. Winchester . If so , this court is committed to the extension . The defendant argues that things imminently dangerous to life are poisons , explosives , deadly weapons -- things whose normal function it is to injure or destroy . But whatever the rule in Thomas v. Winchester may once have been , it has no longer that restricted meaning . A scaffold ( Devlin v. Smith , supra ) is not inherently a destructive instrument . It becomes destructive only if imperfectly constructed . A large coffee urn ( Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co. , supra ) may have within itself , if negligently made , the potency of danger , yet no one thinks of it as an implement whose normal function is destruction . What is true of the coffee urn is equally true of bottles of aerated water ( Torgesen v. Schultz , 192 N.Y. 156 ) . We have mentioned only cases in this court . But the rule has received a like extension in our courts of intermediate appeal . In Burke v. Ireland ( 26 App . Div. 487 ) , in an opinion by CULLEN , J. , it was applied to a builder who constructed a defective building ; in Kahner v. Otis Elevator Co. ( 96 App . Div. 169 ) to the manufacturer of an elevator ; in Davies v. Pelham Hod Elevating Co. ( 65 Hun , 573 ; affirmed in this court without opinion , 146 N.Y. 363 ) to a contractor who furnished a defective rope with knowledge of the purpose for which the rope was to be used . We are not required at this time either to approve or to disapprove the application of the rule that was made in these cases . It is enough that they help to characterize the trend of judicial thought . We hold , then , that the principle of Thomas v. Winchester is not limited to poisons , explosives , and things of like nature , to things which in their normal operation are implements of destruction . If the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made , it is then a thing of danger . Its nature gives warning of the consequences to be expected . If to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser , and used without new tests then , irrespective of contract , the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully ... There must be knowledge of a danger , not merely possible , but probable . Cardozo 's new `` rule '' exists in no prior case , but is inferrable as a synthesis of the `` thing of danger '' principle stated in them , merely extending it to `` foreseeable danger '' even if `` the purposes for which it was designed '' were not themselves `` a source of great danger '' . MacPherson takes some care to present itself as foreseeable progression , not a wild departure . Cardozo continues to adhere to the original principle of Winterbottom , that `` absurd and outrageous consequences '' must be avoided , and he does so by drawing a new line in the last sentence quoted above : `` There must be knowledge of a danger , not merely possible , but probable . '' But while adhering to the underlying principle that some boundary is necessary , MacPherson overruled the prior common law by rendering the formerly dominant factor in the boundary , that is , the privity formality arising out of a contractual relationship between persons , totally irrelevant . Rather , the most important factor in the boundary would be the nature of the thing sold and the foreseeable uses that downstream purchasers would make of the thing . The example of the evolution of the law of negligence in the preceding paragraphs illustrates two crucial principles : ( a ) The common law evolves , this evolution is in the hands of judges , and judges have `` made law '' for hundreds of years . ( b ) The reasons given for a decision are often more important in the long run than the outcome in a particular case . This is the reason that judicial opinions are usually quite long , and give rationales and policies that can be balanced with judgment in future cases , rather than the bright - line rules usually embodied in statutes . Publication of decisions ( edit ) All law systems rely on written publication of the law , so that it is accessible to all . Common law decisions are published in law reports for use by lawyers , courts and the general public . After the American Revolution , Massachusetts became the first state to establish an official Reporter of Decisions . As newer states needed law , they often looked first to the Massachusetts Reports for authoritative precedents as a basis for their own common law . The United States federal courts relied on private publishers until after the Civil War , and only began publishing as a government function in 1874 . West Publishing in Minnesota is the largest private - sector publisher of law reports in the United States . Government publishers typically issue only decisions `` in the raw , '' while private sector publishers often add indexing , editorial analysis , and similar finding aids . Interaction of constitutional , statutory and common law ( edit ) In common law legal systems , the common law is crucial to understanding almost all important areas of law . For example , in England and Wales , in English Canada , and in most states of the United States , the basic law of contracts , torts and property do not exist in statute , but only in common law ( though there may be isolated modifications enacted by statute ) . As another example , the Supreme Court of the United States in 1877 , held that a Michigan statute that established rules for solemnization of marriages did not abolish pre-existing common - law marriage , because the statute did not affirmatively require statutory solemnization and was silent as to preexisting common law . In almost all areas of the law ( even those where there is a statutory framework , such as contracts for the sale of goods , or the criminal law ) , legislature - enacted statutes generally give only terse statements of general principle , and the fine boundaries and definitions exist only in the interstitial common law . To find out what the precise law is that applies to a particular set of facts , one has to locate precedential decisions on the topic , and reason from those decisions by analogy . In ( common law jurisdictions ( in the sense opposed to `` civil law '' ) , legislatures operate under the assumption that statutes will be interpreted against the backdrop of the pre-existing common law . As the United States Supreme Court explained in United States v Texas , 507 U.S. 529 ( 1993 ) : Just as longstanding is the principle that `` ( s ) tatutes which invade the common law ... are to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of long - established and familiar principles , except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident . '' Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson , 343 U.S. 779 , 783 ( 1952 ) ; Astoria Federal Savings & Loan Assn . v. Solimino , 501 U.S. 104 , 108 ( 1991 ) . In such cases , Congress does not write upon a clean slate . Astoria , 501 U.S. at 108 . In order to abrogate a common - law principle , the statute must `` speak directly '' to the question addressed by the common law . Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham , 436 U.S. 618 , 625 ( 1978 ) ; Milwaukee v. Illinois , 451 U.S. 304 , 315 ( 1981 ) . For example , in most U.S. states , the criminal statutes are primarily codification of pre-existing common law . ( Codification is the process of enacting a statute that collects and restates pre-existing law in a single document -- when that pre-existing law is common law , the common law remains relevant to the interpretation of these statutes . ) In reliance on this assumption , modern statutes often leave a number of terms and fine distinctions unstated -- for example , a statute might be very brief , leaving the precise definition of terms unstated , under the assumption that these fine distinctions will be inherited from pre-existing common law . ( For this reason , many modern American law schools teach the common law of crime as it stood in England in 1789 , because that centuries - old English common law is a necessary foundation to interpreting modern criminal statutes . ) With the transition from English law , which had common law crimes , to the new legal system under the U.S. Constitution , which prohibited ex post facto laws at both the federal and state level , the question was raised whether there could be common law crimes in the United States . It was settled in the case of United States v. Hudson , which decided that federal courts had no jurisdiction to define new common law crimes , and that there must always be a ( constitutional ) statute defining the offense and the penalty for it . Still , many states retain selected common law crimes . For example , in Virginia , the definition of the conduct that constitutes the crime of robbery exists only in the common law , and the robbery statute only sets the punishment . Virginia Code section 1 - 200 establishes the continued existence and vitality of common law principles and provides that `` The common law of England , insofar as it is not repugnant to the principles of the Bill of Rights and Constitution of this Commonwealth , shall continue in full force within the same , and be the rule of decision , except as altered by the General Assembly . '' By contrast to statutory codification of common law , some statutes displace common law , for example to create a new cause of action that did not exist in the common law , or to legislatively overrule the common law . An example is the tort of wrongful death , which allows certain persons , usually a spouse , child or estate , to sue for damages on behalf of the deceased . There is no such tort in English common law ; thus , any jurisdiction that lacks a wrongful death statute will not allow a lawsuit for the wrongful death of a loved one . Where a wrongful death statute exists , the compensation or other remedy available is limited to the remedy specified in the statute ( typically , an upper limit on the amount of damages ) . Courts generally interpret statutes that create new causes of action narrowly -- that is , limited to their precise terms -- because the courts generally recognize the legislature as being supreme in deciding the reach of judge - made law unless such statute should violate some `` second order '' constitutional law provision ( cf . judicial activism ) . Where a tort is rooted in common law , all traditionally recognized damages for that tort may be sued for , whether or not there is mention of those damages in the current statutory law . For instance , a person who sustains bodily injury through the negligence of another may sue for medical costs , pain , suffering , loss of earnings or earning capacity , mental and / or emotional distress , loss of quality of life , disfigurement and more . These damages need not be set forth in statute as they already exist in the tradition of common law . However , without a wrongful death statute , most of them are extinguished upon death . In the United States , the power of the federal judiciary to review and invalidate unconstitutional acts of the federal executive branch is stated in the constitution , Article III sections 1 and 2 : `` The judicial Power of the United States , shall be vested in one supreme Court , and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish ... The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases , in Law and Equity , arising under this Constitution , the Laws of the United States , and Treaties made , or which shall be made , under their Authority ... '' The first landmark decision on `` the judicial power '' was Marbury v. Madison , 5 U.S. ( 1 Cranch ) 137 ( 1803 ) . Later cases interpreted the `` judicial power '' of Article III to establish the power of federal courts to consider or overturn any action of Congress or of any state that conflicts with the Constitution . The interactions between decisions of different courts is discussed further in the article on precedent . Overruling precedent -- the limits of stare decisis ( edit ) The United States federal courts are divided into twelve regional circuits , each with a circuit court of appeals ( plus a thirteenth , the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit , which hears appeals in patent cases and cases against the federal government , without geographic limitation ) . Decisions of one circuit court are binding on the district courts within the circuit and on the circuit court itself , but are only persuasive authority on sister circuits . District court decisions are not binding precedent at all , only persuasive . Most of the U.S. federal courts of appeal have adopted a rule under which , in the event of any conflict in decisions of panels ( most of the courts of appeal almost always sit in panels of three ) , the earlier panel decision is controlling , and a panel decision may only be overruled by the court of appeals sitting en banc ( that is , all active judges of the court ) or by a higher court . In these courts , the older decision remains controlling when an issue comes up the third time . Other courts , for example , the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the Supreme Court , always sit en banc , and thus the later decision controls . These courts essentially overrule all previous cases in each new case , and older cases survive only to the extent they do not conflict with newer cases . The interpretations of these courts -- for example , Supreme Court interpretations of the constitution or federal statutes -- are stable only so long as the older interpretation maintains the support of a majority of the court . Older decisions persist through some combination of belief that the old decision is right , and that it is not sufficiently wrong to be overruled . In the UK , since 2009 , the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom has the authority to overrule and unify decisions of lower courts . From 1966 to 2009 , this power lay with the House of Lords , granted by the Practice Statement of 1966 . Canada 's federal system , described below , avoids regional variability of federal law by giving national jurisdiction to both layers of appellate courts . Common law as a foundation for commercial economies ( edit ) The reliance on judicial opinion is a strength of common law systems , and is a significant contributor to the robust commercial systems in the United Kingdom and United States . Because there is reasonably precise guidance on almost every issue , parties ( especially commercial parties ) can predict whether a proposed course of action is likely to be lawful or unlawful , and have some assurance of consistency . As Justice Brandeis famously expressed it , `` in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right . '' This ability to predict gives more freedom to come close to the boundaries of the law . For example , many commercial contracts are more economically efficient , and create greater wealth , because the parties know ahead of time that the proposed arrangement , though perhaps close to the line , is almost certainly legal . Newspapers , taxpayer - funded entities with some religious affiliation , and political parties can obtain fairly clear guidance on the boundaries within which their freedom of expression rights apply . In contrast , in jurisdictions with very weak respect for precedent , fine questions of law are redetermined anew each time they arise , making consistency and prediction more difficult , and procedures far more protracted than necessary because parties can not rely on written statements of law as reliable guides . In jurisdictions that do not have a strong allegiance to a large body of precedent , parties have less a priori guidance ( unless the written law is very clear and kept updated ) and must often leave a bigger `` safety margin '' of unexploited opportunities , and final determinations are reached only after far larger expenditures on legal fees by the parties . This is the reason for the frequent choice of the law of the State of New York in commercial contracts , even when neither entity has extensive contacts with New York -- and remarkably often even when neither party has contacts with the United States . Commercial contracts almost always include a `` choice of law clause '' to reduce uncertainty . Somewhat surprisingly , contracts throughout the world ( for example , contracts involving parties in Japan , France and Germany , and from most of the other states of the United States ) often choose the law of New York , even where the relationship of the parties and transaction to New York is quite attenuated . Because of its history as the United States ' commercial center , New York common law has a depth and predictability not ( yet ) available in any other jurisdictions of the United States . Similarly , American corporations are often formed under Delaware corporate law , and American contracts relating to corporate law issues ( merger and acquisitions of companies , rights of shareholders , and so on . ) include a Delaware choice of law clause , because of the deep body of law in Delaware on these issues . On the other hand , some other jurisdictions have sufficiently developed bodies of law so that parties have no real motivation to choose the law of a foreign jurisdiction ( for example , England and Wales , and the state of California ) , but not yet so fully developed that parties with no relationship to the jurisdiction choose that law . Outside the United States , parties that are in different jurisdictions from each other often choose the law of England and Wales , particularly when the parties are each in former British colonies and members of the Commonwealth . The common theme in all cases is that commercial parties seek predictability and simplicity in their contractual relations , and frequently choose the law of a common law jurisdiction with a well - developed body of common law to achieve that result . Likewise , for litigation of commercial disputes arising out of unpredictable torts ( as opposed to the prospective choice of law clauses in contracts discussed in the previous paragraph ) , certain jurisdictions attract an unusually high fraction of cases , because of the predictability afforded by the depth of decided cases . For example , London is considered the pre-eminent centre for litigation of admiralty cases . This is not to say that common law is better in every situation . For example , civil law can be clearer than case law when the legislature has had the foresight and diligence to address the precise set of facts applicable to a particular situation . For that reason , civil law statutes tend to be somewhat more detailed than statutes written by common law legislatures -- but , conversely , that tends to make the statute more difficult to read ( the United States tax code is an example ) . History ( edit ) See also : English law Origins ( edit ) The common law -- so named because it was `` common '' to all the king 's courts across England -- originated in the practices of the courts of the English kings in the centuries following the Norman Conquest in 1066 . Prior to the Norman Conquest , much of England 's legal business took place in the local folk courts of its various shires and hundreds . A variety of other individual courts also existed across the land : urban boroughs and merchant fairs held their own courts , as did the universities of Oxford and Cambridge , and large landholders also held their own manorial and seigniorial courts as needed . Additionally , the Catholic Church operated its own court system that adjudicated issues of canon law . The main sources for the history of the common law in the Middle Ages are the plea rolls and the Year Books . The plea rolls , which were the official court records for the Courts of Common Pleas and King 's Bench , were written in Latin . The rolls were made up in bundles by law term : Hilary , Easter , Trinity , and Michaelmas , or winter , spring , summer , and autumn . They are currently deposited in the UK National Archives , by whose permission images of the rolls for the Courts of Common Pleas , King 's Bench , and Exchequer of Pleas , from the 13th century to the 17th , can be viewed online at the Anglo - American Legal Tradition site ( The O'Quinn Law Library of the University of Houston Law Center ) . The doctrine of precedent developed during the 12th and 13th centuries , as the collective judicial decisions that were based in tradition , custom and precedent . The form of reasoning used in common law is known as casuistry or case - based reasoning . The common law , as applied in civil cases ( as distinct from criminal cases ) , was devised as a means of compensating someone for wrongful acts known as torts , including both intentional torts and torts caused by negligence , and as developing the body of law recognizing and regulating contracts . The type of procedure practiced in common law courts is known as the adversarial system ; this is also a development of the common law . Medieval English common law ( edit ) The early development of case - law in the thirteenth century has been traced to Bracton 's On the Laws and Customs of England and led to the yearly compilations of court cases known as Year Books , of which the first extant was published in 1268 , the same year that Bracton died . The Year Books are known as the law reports of medieval England , and are a principal source for knowledge of the developing legal doctrines , concepts , and methods in the period from the 13th to the 16th centuries , when the common law developed into recognizable form . A view of Westminster Hall in the Palace of Westminster , London , early 19th Century . In 1154 , Henry II became the first Plantagenet king . Among many achievements , Henry institutionalized common law by creating a unified system of law `` common '' to the country through incorporating and elevating local custom to the national , ending local control and peculiarities , eliminating arbitrary remedies and reinstating a jury system -- citizens sworn on oath to investigate reliable criminal accusations and civil claims . The jury reached its verdict through evaluating common local knowledge , not necessarily through the presentation of evidence , a distinguishing factor from today 's civil and criminal court systems . Henry II developed the practice of sending judges from his own central court to hear the various disputes throughout the country . His judges would resolve disputes on an ad hoc basis according to what they interpreted the customs to be . The king 's judges would then return to London and often discuss their cases and the decisions they made with the other judges . These decisions would be recorded and filed . In time , a rule , known as stare decisis ( also commonly known as precedent ) developed , whereby a judge would be bound to follow the decision of an earlier judge ; he was required to adopt the earlier judge 's interpretation of the law and apply the same principles promulgated by that earlier judge if the two cases had similar facts to one another . Once judges began to regard each other 's decisions to be binding precedent , the pre-Norman system of local customs and law varying in each locality was replaced by a system that was ( at least in theory , though not always in practice ) common throughout the whole country , hence the name `` common law '' . Henry II 's creation of a powerful and unified court system , which curbed somewhat the power of canonical ( church ) courts , brought him ( and England ) into conflict with the church , most famously with Thomas Becket , the Archbishop of Canterbury . The murder of the Archbishop gave rise to a wave of popular outrage against the King . Henry was forced to repeal the disputed laws and to abandon his efforts to hold church members accountable for secular crimes ( see also Constitutions of Clarendon ) . The English Court of Common Pleas was established after Magna Carta to try lawsuits between commoners in which the monarch had no interest . Its judges sat in open court in the Great Hall of the king 's Palace of Westminster , permanently except in the vacations between the four terms of the Legal year . Judge - made common law operated as the primary source of law for several hundred years , before Parliament acquired legislative powers to create statutory law . It is important to understand that common law is the older and more traditional source of law , and legislative power is simply a layer applied on top of the older common law foundation . Since the 12th century , courts have had parallel and co-equal authority to make law -- `` legislating from the bench '' is a traditional and essential function of courts , which was carried over into the U.S. system as an essential component of the `` judicial power '' specified by Article III of the U.S. constitution . Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr. summarized centuries of history in 1917 , `` judges do and must legislate . '' There are legitimate debates on how the powers of courts and legislatures should be balanced . However , the view that courts lack law - making power is historically inaccurate and constitutionally unsupportable . In England , judges have devised a number of rules as to how to deal with precedent decisions . Influence of Roman law ( edit ) The term `` common law '' is often used as a contrast to Roman - derived `` civil law '' , and the fundamental processes and forms of reasoning in the two are quite different . Nonetheless , there has been considerable cross-fertilization of ideas , while the two traditions and sets of foundational principles remain distinct . By the time of the rediscovery of the Roman law in Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries , the common law had already developed far enough to prevent a Roman law reception as it occurred on the continent . However , the first common law scholars , most notably Glanvill and Bracton , as well as the early royal common law judges , had been well accustomed with Roman law . Often , they were clerics trained in the Roman canon law . One of the first and throughout its history one of the most significant treatises of the common law , Bracton 's De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae ( On the Laws and Customs of England ) , was heavily influenced by the division of the law in Justinian 's Institutes . The impact of Roman law had decreased sharply after the age of Bracton , but the Roman divisions of actions into in rem ( typically , actions against a thing or property for the purpose of gaining title to that property ; must be filed in a court where the property is located ) and in personam ( typically , actions directed against a person ; these can affect a person 's rights and , since a person often owns things , his property too ) used by Bracton had a lasting effect and laid the groundwork for a return of Roman law structural concepts in the 18th and 19th centuries . Signs of this can be found in Blackstone 's Commentaries on the Laws of England , and Roman law ideas regained importance with the revival of academic law schools in the 19th century . As a result , today , the main systematic divisions of the law into property , contract , and tort ( and to some extent unjust enrichment ) can be found in the civil law as well as in the common law . Coke and Blackstone ( edit ) The first attempt at a comprehensive compilation of centuries of common law was by Lord Chief Justice Edward Coke , in his treatise , Institutes of the Lawes of England in the 17th century . The next definitive historical treatise on the common law is Commentaries on the Laws of England , written by Sir William Blackstone and first published in 1765 -- 1769 . Propagation of the common law to the colonies and Commonwealth by reception statutes ( edit ) A reception statute is a statutory law adopted as a former British colony becomes independent , by which the new nation adopts ( i.e. receives ) pre-independence common law , to the extent not explicitly rejected by the legislative body or constitution of the new nation . Reception statutes generally consider the English common law dating prior to independence , and the precedent originating from it , as the default law , because of the importance of using an extensive and predictable body of law to govern the conduct of citizens and businesses in a new state . All U.S. states , with the partial exception of Louisiana , have either implemented reception statutes or adopted the common law by judicial opinion . Other examples of reception statutes in the United States , the states of the U.S. , Canada and its provinces , and Hong Kong , are discussed in the reception statute article . Yet , adoption of the common law in the newly - independent nation was not a foregone conclusion , and was controversial . Immediately after the American Revolution , there was widespread distrust and hostility to anything British , and the common law was no exception . Jeffersonians decried lawyers and their common law tradition as threats to the new republic . The Jeffersonians preferred a legislatively - enacted civil law under the control of the political process , rather than the common law developed by judges that -- by design -- were insulated from the political process . The Federalists believed that the common law was the birthright of Independence : after all , the natural rights to `` life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness '' were the rights protected by common law . Even advocates for the common law approach noted that it was not an ideal fit for the newly - independent colonies : judges and lawyers alike were severely hindered by a lack of printed legal materials . Before Independence , the most comprehensive law libraries had been maintained by Tory lawyers , and those libraries vanished with the loyalist expatriation , and the ability to print books was limited . Lawyer ( later president ) John Adams complained that he `` suffered very much for the want of books '' . To bootstrap this most basic need of a common law system -- knowable , written law -- in 1803 , lawyers in Massachusetts donated their books to found a law library . A Jeffersonian newspaper criticized the library , as it would carry forward `` all the old authorities practiced in England for centuries back ... whereby a new system of jurisprudence ( will be founded ) on the high monarchical system ( to ) become the Common Law of this Commonwealth ... ( The library ) may hereafter have a very unsocial purpose . '' Decline of Latin maxims and `` blind imitation of the past '' , and adding flexibility to stare decisis ( edit ) Well into the 19th century , ancient maxims played a large role in common law adjudication . Many of these maxims had originated in Roman Law , migrated to England before the introduction of Christianity to the British Isles , and were typically stated in Latin even in English decisions . Many examples are familiar in everyday speech even today , `` One can not be a judge in one 's own cause '' ( see Dr. Bonham 's Case ) , rights are reciprocal to obligations , and the like . Judicial decisions and treatises of the 17th and 18th centuries , such at those of Lord Chief Justice Edward Coke , presented the common law as a collection of such maxims . Reliance on old maxims and rigid adherence to precedent , no matter how old or ill - considered , came under critical discussion in the late 19th century , starting in the United States . Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr. in his famous article , `` The Path of the Law '' , commented , `` It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV . It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since , and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past . '' Justice Holmes noted that study of maxims might be sufficient for `` the man of the present '' , but `` the man of the future is the man of statistics and the master of economics '' . In an 1880 lecture at Harvard , he wrote : The life of the law has not been logic ; it has been experience . The felt necessities of the time , the prevalent moral and political theories , intuitions of public policy , avowed or unconscious , even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow men , have had a good deal more to do than the syllogism in determining the rules by which men should be governed . The law embodies the story of a nation 's development through many centuries , and it can not be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics . In the early 20th century , Louis Brandeis , later appointed to the United States Supreme Court , became noted for his use of policy - driving facts and economics in his briefs , and extensive appendices presenting facts that lead a judge to the advocate 's conclusion . By this time , briefs relied more on facts than on Latin maxims . Reliance on old maxims is now deprecated . Common law decisions today reflect both precedent and policy judgment drawn from economics , the social sciences , business , decisions of foreign courts , and the like . The degree to which these external factors should influence adjudication is the subject of active debate , but it is indisputable that judges do draw on experience and learning from everyday life , from other fields , and from other jurisdictions . 1870 through 20th century , and the procedural merger of law and equity ( edit ) As early as the 15th century , it became the practice that litigants who felt they had been cheated by the common law system would petition the King in person . For example , they might argue that an award of damages ( at common law ( as opposed to equity ) ) was not sufficient redress for a trespasser occupying their land , and instead request that the trespasser be evicted . From this developed the system of equity , administered by the Lord Chancellor , in the courts of chancery . By their nature , equity and law were frequently in conflict and litigation would frequently continue for years as one court countermanded the other , even though it was established by the 17th century that equity should prevail . In England , courts of law ( as opposed to equity ) were combined with courts of equity by the Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875 , with equity prevailing in case of conflict . In the United States , parallel systems of law ( providing money damages , with cases heard by a jury upon either party 's request ) and equity ( fashioning a remedy to fit the situation , including injunctive relief , heard by a judge ) survived well into the 20th century . The United States federal courts procedurally separated law and equity : the same judges could hear either kind of case , but a given case could only pursue causes in law or in equity , and the two kinds of cases proceeded under different procedural rules . This became problematic when a given case required both money damages and injunctive relief . In 1937 , the new Federal Rules of Civil Procedure combined law and equity into one form of action , the `` civil action '' . Fed. R. Civ. P. 2 . The distinction survives to the extent that issues that were `` common law ( as opposed to equity ) '' as of 1791 ( the date of adoption of the Seventh Amendment ) are still subject to the right of either party to request a jury , and `` equity '' issues are decided by a judge . Delaware , Mississippi , and Tennessee still have separate courts of law and equity , for example , the Court of Chancery . In many states there are separate divisions for law and equity within one court . Common law pleading and its abolition in the early 20th century ( edit ) For centuries , through the 19th century , the common law recognized only specific forms of action , and required very careful drafting of the opening pleading ( called a writ ) to slot into exactly one of them : Debt , Detinue , Covenant , Special Assumpsit , General Assumpsit , Trespass , Trover , Replevin , Case ( or Trespass on the Case ) , and Ejectment . To initiate a lawsuit , a pleading had to be drafted to meet myriad technical requirements : correctly categorizing the case into the correct legal pigeonhole ( pleading in the alternative was not permitted ) , and using specific `` magic words '' encrusted over the centuries . Under the old common law pleading standards , a suit by a pro se ( `` for oneself , '' without a lawyer ) party was all but impossible , and there was often considerable procedural jousting at the outset of a case over minor wording issues . One of the major reforms of the late 19th century and early 20th century was the abolition of common law pleading requirements . A plaintiff can initiate a case by giving the defendant `` a short and plain statement '' of facts that constitute an alleged wrong . This reform moved the attention of courts from technical scrutiny of words to a more rational consideration of the facts , and opened access to justice far more broadly . Alternatives to common law systems ( edit ) Civil law systems -- comparisons and contrasts to common law ( edit ) A 16th century edition of Corpus Juris Civilis Romani ( 1583 ) The main alternative to the common law system is the civil law system , which is used in Continental Europe , and most of the rest of the world . Judicial decisions play only a minor role in shaping civil law ( edit ) The primary contrast between the two systems is the role of written decisions and precedent . In common law jurisdictions , nearly every case that presents a bona fide disagreement on the law is resolved in a written opinion . The legal reasoning for the decision , known as ratio decidendi , not only determines the court 's judgment between the parties , but also stands as precedent for resolving future disputes . In contrast , civil law decisions typically do not include explanatory opinions , and thus no precedent flows from one decision to the next . In common law systems , a single decided case is binding common law ( connotation 1 ) to the same extent as statute or regulation , under the principle of stare decisis . In contrast , in civil law systems , individual decisions have only advisory , not binding effect . In civil law systems , case law only acquires weight when a long series of cases use consistent reasoning , called jurisprudence constante . Civil law lawyers consult case law to obtain their best prediction of how a court will rule , but comparatively , civil law judges are less bound to follow it . For that reason , statutes in civil law systems are more comprehensive , detailed , and continuously updated , covering all matters capable of being brought before a court . Adversarial system vs. inquisitorial system ( edit ) Common law systems tend to give more weight to separation of powers between the judicial branch and the executive branch . In contrast , civil law systems are typically more tolerant of allowing individual officials to exercise both powers . One example of this contrast is the difference between the two systems in allocation of responsibility between prosecutor and adjudicator . Common law courts usually use an adversarial system , in which two sides present their cases to a neutral judge . In contrast , in civil law systems , criminal proceedings proceed under an inquisitorial system in which an examining magistrate serves two roles by developing the evidence and arguments for one side and then the other during the investigation phase . The examining magistrate then presents the dossier detailing his or her findings to the president of the bench that will adjudicate on the case where it has been decided that a trial shall be conducted . Therefore , the president of the bench 's view of the case is not neutral and may be biased while conducting the trial after the reading of the dossier . Unlike the common law proceedings , the president of the bench in the inquisitorial system is not merely an umpire and is entitled to directly interview the witnesses or express comments during the trial , as long as he or she does not express his or her view on the guilt of the accused . The proceeding in the inquisitorial system is essentially by writing . Most of the witnesses would have given evidence in the investigation phase and such evidence will be contained in the dossier under the form of police reports . In the same way , the accused would have already put his or her case at the investigation phase but he or she will be free to change her or his evidence at trial . Whether the accused pleads guilty or not , a trial will be conducted . Unlike the adversarial system , the conviction and sentence to be served ( if any ) will be released by the trial jury together with the president of the trial bench , following their common deliberation . There are many exceptions in both directions . For example , most proceedings before U.S. federal and state agencies are inquisitorial in nature , at least the initial stages ( e.g. , a patent examiner , a social security hearing officer , and so on ) , even though the law to be applied is developed through common law processes . Contrasting role of treatises and academic writings in common law and civil law systems ( edit ) The role of the legal academy presents a significant `` cultural '' difference between common law ( connotation 2 ) and civil law jurisdictions . In both systems , treatises compile decisions and state overarching principles that ( in the author 's opinion ) explain the results of the cases . In neither system are treatises considered `` law , '' but the weight given them is nonetheless quite different . In common law jurisdictions , lawyers and judges tend to use these treatises as only `` finding aids '' to locate the relevant cases . In common law jurisdictions , scholarly work is seldom cited as authority for what the law is . Chief Justice Roberts noted the `` great disconnect between the academy and the profession . '' When common law courts rely on scholarly work , it is almost always only for factual findings , policy justification , or the history and evolution of the law , but the court 's legal conclusion is reached through analysis of relevant statutes and common law , seldom scholarly commentary . In contrast , in civil law jurisdictions , courts give the writings of law professors significant weight , partly because civil law decisions traditionally were very brief , sometimes no more than a paragraph stating who wins and who loses . The rationale had to come from somewhere else : the academy often filled that role . Narrowing of differences between common law and civil law ( edit ) The contrast between civil law and common law legal systems has become increasingly blurred , with the growing importance of jurisprudence ( similar to case law but not binding ) in civil law countries , and the growing importance of statute law and codes in common law countries . Examples of common law being replaced by statute or codified rule in the United States include criminal law ( since 1812 , U.S. federal courts and most but not all of the States have held that criminal law must be embodied in statute if the public is to have fair notice ) , commercial law ( the Uniform Commercial Code in the early 1960s ) and procedure ( the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in the 1930s and the Federal Rules of Evidence in the 1970s ) . But note that in each case , the statute sets the general principles , but the interstitial common law process determines the scope and application of the statute . An example of convergence from the other direction is shown in the 1982 decision Srl CILFIT and Lanificio di Gavardo SpA v Ministry of Health ( ECLI : EU : C : 1982 : 335 ) , in which the European Court of Justice held that questions it has already answered need not be resubmitted . This showed how a historically distinctly common law principle is used by a court composed of judges ( at that time ) of essentially civil law jurisdiction . Other alternatives ( edit ) The former Soviet Bloc and other Socialist countries used a Socialist law system . Much of the Muslim world uses Sharia ( also called Islamic law ) . Common law legal systems in the present day ( edit ) In jurisdictions around the world ( edit ) The common law constitutes the basis of the legal systems of : Australia ( both federal and individual states ) , Bangladesh , Belize , Brunei , Canada ( both federal and the individual provinces ( except Quebec ) ) , the Caribbean jurisdictions of Antigua and Barbuda , Barbados , Bahamas , Dominica , Grenada , Jamaica , St Vincent and the Grenadines , Saint Kitts and Nevis , Trinidad and Tobago , Ghana , Hong Kong , India , Ireland , Israel , Kenya , Malaysia , Myanmar , New Zealand , Pakistan , Singapore , South Africa , United Kingdom : England and Wales , Northern Ireland , United States ( both the federal system and the individual states ( with the partial exception of Louisiana ) ) , and many other generally English - speaking countries or Commonwealth countries ( except the UK 's Scotland , which is bijuridicial , and Malta ) . Essentially , every country that was colonised at some time by England , Great Britain , or the United Kingdom uses common law except those that were formerly colonised by other nations , such as Quebec ( which follows the law of France in part ) , South Africa and Sri Lanka ( which follow Roman Dutch law ) , where the prior civil law system was retained to respect the civil rights of the local colonists . Guyana and Saint Lucia have mixed Common Law and Civil Law systems . The remainder of this section discusses jurisdiction - specific variants , arranged chronologically . Scotland ( edit ) Scotland is often said to use the civil law system , but it has a unique system that combines elements of an uncodified civil law dating back to the Corpus Juris Civilis with an element of its own common law long predating the Treaty of Union with England in 1707 ( see Legal institutions of Scotland in the High Middle Ages ) , founded on the customary laws of the tribes residing there . Historically , Scottish common law differed in that the use of precedent was subject to the courts ' seeking to discover the principle that justifies a law rather than searching for an example as a precedent , and principles of natural justice and fairness have always played a role in Scots Law . From the 19th century , the Scottish approach to precedent developed into a stare decisis akin to that already established in England thereby reflecting a narrower , more modern approach to the application of case law in subsequent instances . This is not to say that the substantive rules of the common laws of both countries are the same although in many matters ( particularly those of UK - wide interest ) they are similar . Scotland shares the Supreme Court , with England , Wales and Northern Ireland for civil cases ; the court 's decisions are binding on the jurisdiction from which a case arises but only influential on similar cases arising in Scotland . This has had the effect of converging the law in certain areas . For instance , the modern UK law of negligence is based on Donoghue v Stevenson , a case originating in Paisley , Scotland . Scotland maintains a separate criminal law system from the rest of the UK , with the High Court of Justiciary being the final court for criminal appeals . The highest court of appeal in civil cases brought in Scotland is now the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ( before October 2009 , final appellate jurisdiction lay with the House of Lords ) . United States ( edit ) States of the United States ( 17th century on ) ( edit ) The centuries - old authority of the common law courts in England to develop law case by case and to apply statute law -- `` legislating from the bench '' -- is a traditional function of courts , which was carried over into the U.S. system as an essential component of the `` judicial power '' specified by Article III of the U.S. constitution . Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr. summarized centuries of history in 1917 , `` judges do and must legislate '' ( in the federal courts , only interstitially , in state courts , to the full limits of common law adjudicatory authority ) . New York ( 17th century ) ( edit ) The state of New York , which also has a civil law history from its Dutch colonial days , began a codification of its law in the 19th century . The only part of this codification process that was considered complete is known as the Field Code applying to civil procedure . The original colony of New Netherland was settled by the Dutch and the law was also Dutch . When the English captured pre-existing colonies they continued to allow the local settlers to keep their civil law . However , the Dutch settlers revolted against the English and the colony was recaptured by the Dutch . When the English finally regained control of New Netherland they forced , as a punishment unique in the history of the British Empire , the English imposed common law upon all the colonists , including the Dutch . This was problematic , as the patroon system of land holding , based on the feudal system and civil law , continued to operate in the colony until it was abolished in the mid-19th century . The influence of Roman - Dutch law continued in the colony well into the late 19th century . The codification of a law of general obligations shows how remnants of the civil law tradition in New York continued on from the Dutch days . Louisiana ( 1700s ) ( edit ) Under Louisiana 's codified system , the Louisiana Civil Code , private law -- that is , substantive law between private sector parties -- is based on principles of law from continental Europe , with some common law influences . These principles derive ultimately from Roman law , transmitted through French law and Spanish law , as the state 's current territory intersects the area of North America colonized by Spain and by France . Contrary to popular belief , the Louisiana code does not directly derive from the Napoleonic Code , as the latter was enacted in 1804 , one year after the Louisiana Purchase . However , the two codes are similar in many respects due to common roots . Louisiana 's criminal law largely rests on English common law . Louisiana 's administrative law is generally similar to the administrative law of the U.S. federal government and other U.S. states . Louisiana 's procedural law is generally in line with that of other U.S. states , which in turn is generally based on the U.S. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure . Historically notable among the Louisiana code 's differences from common law is the role of property rights among women , particularly in inheritance gained by widows . California ( 1850s ) ( edit ) The U.S. state of California has a system based on common law , but it has codified the law in the manner of the civil law jurisdictions . The reason for the enactment of the California Codes in the 19th century was to replace a pre-existing system based on Spanish civil law with a system based on common law , similar to that in most other states . California and a number of other Western states , however , have retained the concept of community property derived from civil law . The California courts have treated portions of the codes as an extension of the common - law tradition , subject to judicial development in the same manner as judge - made common law . ( Most notably , in the case Li v. Yellow Cab Co. , 13 Cal. 3d 804 ( 1975 ) , the California Supreme Court adopted the principle of comparative negligence in the face of a California Civil Code provision codifying the traditional common - law doctrine of contributory negligence . ) United States federal courts ( 1789 and 1938 ) ( edit ) USCA : some annotated volumes of the official compilation and codification of federal statutes . The United States federal government ( as opposed to the states ) has a variant on a common law system . United States federal courts only act as interpreters of statutes and the constitution by elaborating and precisely defining broad statutory language ( connotation 1 ( b ) above ) , but , unlike state courts , do not act as an independent source of common law . Before 1938 , the federal courts , like almost all other common law courts , decided the law on any issue where the relevant legislature ( either the U.S. Congress or state legislature , depending on the issue ) , had not acted , by looking to courts in the same system , that is , other federal courts , even on issues of state law , and even where there was no express grant of authority from Congress or the Constitution . In 1938 , the U.S. Supreme Court in Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins 304 U.S. 64 , 78 ( 1938 ) , overruled earlier precedent , and held `` There is no federal general common law , '' thus confining the federal courts to act only as interpreters of law originating elsewhere . E.g. , Texas Industries v. Radcliff , 451 U.S. 630 ( 1981 ) ( without an express grant of statutory authority , federal courts can not create rules of intuitive justice , for example , a right to contribution from co-conspirators ) . Post-1938 , federal courts deciding issues that arise under state law are required to defer to state court interpretations of state statutes , or reason what a state 's highest court would rule if presented with the issue , or to certify the question to the state 's highest court for resolution . Later courts have limited Erie slightly , to create a few situations where United States federal courts are permitted to create federal common law rules without express statutory authority , for example , where a federal rule of decision is necessary to protect uniquely federal interests , such as foreign affairs , or financial instruments issued by the federal government . See , e.g. , Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States , 318 U.S. 363 ( 1943 ) ( giving federal courts the authority to fashion common law rules with respect to issues of federal power , in this case negotiable instruments backed by the federal government ) ; see also International News Service v. Associated Press , 248 U.S. 215 ( 1918 ) ( creating a cause of action for misappropriation of `` hot news '' that lacks any statutory grounding ) ; but see National Basketball Association v. Motorola , Inc. , 105 F. 3d 841 , 843 -- 44 , 853 ( 2d Cir. 1997 ) ( noting continued vitality of INS `` hot news '' tort under New York state law , but leaving open the question of whether it survives under federal law ) . Except on Constitutional issues , Congress is free to legislatively overrule federal courts ' common law . United States executive branch agencies ( 1946 ) ( edit ) Most executive branch agencies in the United States federal government have some adjudicatory authority . To greater or lesser extent , agencies honor their own precedent to ensure consistent results . Agency decision making is governed by the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 . For example , the National Labor Relations Board issues relatively few regulations , but instead promulgates most of its substantive rules through common law ( connotation 1 ) . India , Pakistan , and Bangladesh ( 19th century and 1948 ) ( edit ) The law of India , Pakistan , and Bangladesh are largely based on English common law because of the long period of British colonial influence during the period of the British Raj . Ancient India represented a distinct tradition of law , and had an historically independent school of legal theory and practice . The Arthashastra , dating from 400 BCE and the Manusmriti , from 100 CE , were influential treatises in India , texts that were considered authoritative legal guidance . Manu 's central philosophy was tolerance and pluralism , and was cited across Southeast Asia . Early in this period , which finally culminated in the creation of the Gupta Empire , relations with ancient Greece and Rome were not infrequent . The appearance of similar fundamental institutions of international law in various parts of the world show that they are inherent in international society , irrespective of culture and tradition . Inter-State relations in the pre-Islamic period resulted in clear - cut rules of warfare of a high humanitarian standard , in rules of neutrality , of treaty law , of customary law embodied in religious charters , in exchange of embassies of a temporary or semi-permanent character . When India became part of the British Empire , there was a break in tradition , and Hindu and Islamic law were supplanted by the common law . After the failed rebellion against the British in 1857 , the British Parliament took over control of India from the British East India Company , and British India came under the direct rule of the Crown . The British Parliament passed the Government of India Act of 1858 to this effect , which set up the structure of British government in India . It established in Britain the office of the Secretary of State for India through whom the Parliament would exercise its rule , along with a Council of India to aid him . It also established the office of the Governor - General of India along with an Executive Council in India , which consisted of high officials of the British Government . As a result , the present judicial system of the country derives largely from the British system and has little correlation to the institutions of the pre-British era . Post-partition India ( 1948 ) ( edit ) The Constitution of India is the longest written constitution for a country , containing 395 articles , 12 schedules , numerous amendments and 117,369 words . Post-partition , India retained its common law system . Much of contemporary Indian law shows substantial European and American influence . Legislation first introduced by the British is still in effect in modified form today . During the drafting of the Indian Constitution , laws from Ireland , the United States , Britain , and France were all synthesized to produce a refined set of Indian laws . Indian laws also adhere to the United Nations guidelines on human rights law and environmental law . Certain international trade laws , such as those on intellectual property , are also enforced in India . The exception to this rule is in the state of Goa , annexed in stages in the 1960s through 1980s . In Goa , a Portuguese uniform civil code is in place , in which all religions have a common law regarding marriages , divorces and adoption . Post-partition Pakistan ( 1948 ) ( edit ) Post-partition , Pakistan retained its common law system . Post-partition Bangladesh ( 1968 ) ( edit ) Post-partition , Bangladesh retained its common law system . Canada ( 1867 ) ( edit ) Canada has separate federal and provincial legal systems . The division of jurisdiction between the federal and provincial Parliaments is specified in the Canadian constitution . Canadian provincial law ( edit ) Each province and territory is considered a separate jurisdiction with respect to common law matters . As such , only the provincial legislature may enact legislation to amend private law . Each has its own procedural law , statutorily created provincial courts and superior trial courts with inherent jurisdiction culminating in the Court of Appeal of the province . This is the highest court in provincial jurisdiction , only subject to the Supreme Court of Canada in terms of appeal of their decisions . All but one of the provinces of Canada use a common law system ( the exception being Quebec , which uses a French - heritage civil law system for issues arising within provincial jurisdiction , such as property ownership and contracts ) . Canadian federal law ( edit ) Canadian Federal Courts operate under a separate system throughout Canada and deal with narrower subject matter than superior courts in provincial jurisdiction . They hear cases reserved for federal jurisdiction by the Canadian constitution , such as immigration , intellectual property , judicial review of federal government decisions , and admiralty . The Federal Court of Appeal is the appellate level court in federal jurisdiction and hears cases in multiple cities , and unlike the United States , the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal is not divided into appellate circuits . Criminal law is uniform throughout Canada . It is based on the constitution and federal statutory Criminal Code , as interpreted by the Supreme Court of Canada . The administration of justice and enforcement of the criminal code are the responsibilities of the provinces . Canadian federal statutes must use the terminology of both the common law and civil law for those matters ; this is referred to as legislative bijuralism . Nicaragua ( edit ) Nicaragua 's legal system is also a mixture of the English Common Law and Civil Law . This situation was brought through the influence of British administration of the Eastern half of the Mosquito Coast from the mid-17th century until about 1894 , the William Walker period from about 1855 through 1857 , USA interventions / occupations during the period from 1909 to 1933 , the influence of USA institutions during the Somoza family administrations ( 1933 through 1979 ) and the considerable importation between 1979 and the present of USA culture and institutions . Israel ( 1948 ) ( edit ) Israel has a common law legal system . Its basic principles are inherited from the law of the British Mandate of Palestine and thus resemble those of British and American law , namely : the role of courts in creating the body of law and the authority of the supreme court in reviewing and if necessary overturning legislative and executive decisions , as well as employing the adversarial system . One of the primary reasons that the Israeli constitution remains unwritten is the fear by whatever party holds power that creating a written constitution , combined with the common - law elements , would severely limit the powers of the Knesset ( which , following the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty , holds near - unlimited power ) . Roman Dutch common law ( edit ) Roman Dutch Common law is a bijuridical or mixed system of law similar to the common law system in Scotland and Louisiana . Roman Dutch common law jurisdictions include South Africa , Botswana , Lesotho , Namibia , Swaziland , Sri - Lanka and Zimbabwe . Many of these jurisdictions recognise customary law , and in some , such as South Africa the Constitution requires that the common law be developed in accordance with the Bill of Rights . Roman Dutch common law is a development of Roman Dutch law by courts in the Roman Dutch common law jurisdictions . During the Napoleonic wars the Kingdom of the Netherlands adopted the French code civil in 1809 , however the Dutch colonies in the Cape of Good Hope and Sri Lanka , at the time called Ceylon , were seized by the British to prevent them being used as bases by the French Navy . The system was developed by the courts and spread with the expansion of British colonies in Southern Africa . Roman Dutch common law relies on legal principles set out in Roman law sources such as Justinian 's Institutes and Digest , and also on the writing of Dutch jurists of the 17th century such as Grotius and Voet . In practice , the majority of decisions rely on recent precedent . Ghana ( edit ) Ghana follows the English common - law tradition which was inherited from the British during her colonisation . Consequently , the laws of Ghana are , for the most part , a modified version of imported law that is continuously adapting to changing socio - economic and political realities of the country . The Bond of 184 4 was the first most important event in the history of Ghana ( then Gold Coast ) that marked the critical period when the people ceded their independence to the British and gave the British judicial authority . Later , the Supreme Court Ordinance of 1876 `` formally '' introduced British law , be it the common law or statutory law , in the Gold Coast . Section 14 of the Ordinance formalised the application of the common - law tradition in the country . Ghana , after independence , did not do away with the common law system inherited from the British , and today it has been enshrined in the 1992 Constitution of the country . Chapter four of Ghana 's Constitution , entitled `` The Laws of Ghana '' , has in Article 11 ( 1 ) the list of laws applicable in the state . This comprises ( a ) the Constitution ; ( b ) enactments made by or under the authority of the Parliament established by the Constitution ; ( c ) any Orders , Rules and Regulations made by any person or authority under a power conferred by the Constitution ; ( d ) the existing law ; and ( e ) the common law . Thus , the modern - day Constitution of Ghana , like those before it , embraced the English common law by entrenching it in its provisions . The doctrine of judicial precedence which is based on the principle of stare decisis as applied in England and other pure common law countries also applies in Ghana . Scholarly works ( edit ) Sir William Blackstone as illustrated in his Commentaries on the Laws of England . Edward Coke , a 17th - century Lord Chief Justice of the English Court of Common Pleas and a Member of Parliament , wrote several legal texts that collected and integrated centuries of case law . Lawyers in both England and America learned the law from his Institutes and Reports until the end of the 18th century . His works are still cited by common law courts around the world . The next definitive historical treatise on the common law is Commentaries on the Laws of England , written by Sir William Blackstone and first published in 1765 -- 1769 . Since 1979 , a facsimile edition of that first edition has been available in four paper - bound volumes . Today it has been superseded in the English part of the United Kingdom by Halsbury 's Laws of England that covers both common and statutory English law . While he was still on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court , and before being named to the U.S. Supreme Court , Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr. published a short volume called The Common Law , which remains a classic in the field . Unlike Blackstone and the Restatements , Holmes ' book only briefly discusses what the law is ; rather , Holmes describes the common law process . Law professor John Chipman Gray 's The Nature and Sources of the Law , an examination and survey of the common law , is also still commonly read in U.S. law schools . In the United States , Restatements of various subject matter areas ( Contracts , Torts , Judgments , and so on . ) , edited by the American Law Institute , collect the common law for the area . The ALI Restatements are often cited by American courts and lawyers for propositions of uncodified common law , and are considered highly persuasive authority , just below binding precedential decisions . The Corpus Juris Secundum is an encyclopedia whose main content is a compendium of the common law and its variations throughout the various state jurisdictions . Scots common law covers matters including murder and theft , and has sources in custom , in legal writings and previous court decisions . The legal writings used are called Institutional Texts and come mostly from the 17th , 18th and 19th centuries . Examples include Craig , Jus Feudale ( 1655 ) and Stair , The Institutions of the Law of Scotland ( 1681 ) .

For we know that the common law is that system of law which was introduced by the Saxons on their settlement in England , and altered from time to time by proper legislative authority from that time to the date of Magna Carta , which terminates the period of the common law , or lex non scripta , and commences that of the statute law , or Lex Scripta .

But Christianity was not introduced till the seventh century ; the conversion of the first christian king of the Heptarchy having taken place about the year 598 , and that of the last about 686 .

( January 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Taos County , New Mexico . Justice of the Peace Montoyo hears a minor case . ( 1941 ) A justice of the peace ( JP ) is a judicial officer , of a lower or puisne court , elected or appointed by means of a commission ( letters patent ) to keep the peace . In past centuries the term commissioner of the peace was often used with the same meaning . Depending on the jurisdiction , such justices dispense summary justice or merely deal with local administrative applications in common law jurisdictions . Justices of the peace are appointed or elected from the citizens of the jurisdiction in which they serve , and are ( or were ) usually not required to have any formal legal education in order to qualify for the office . Some jurisdictions have varying forms of training for JPs .

They were responsible to the King for ensuring that the law was upheld and preserving the `` King 's peace '' . Therefore , they were known as `` keepers of the peace '' . An act of 1327 had referred to `` good and lawful men '' to be appointed in every county in the land to `` guard the peace '' ; such individuals were first referred to as conservators of the peace , or wardens of the peace . The title justice of the peace derives from 1361 , in the reign of Edward III . The `` peace '' to be guarded is the sovereign 's , the maintenance of which is the duty of the Crown under the royal prerogative . Justices of the peace still use the power conferred or re-conferred on them since 1361 to bind over unruly persons `` to be of good behaviour '' . The bind over is not a punishment , but a preventive measure , intended to ensure that people thought likely to offend will not do so . The justices ' alternative title of `` magistrate '' dates from the 16th century , although the word had been in use centuries earlier to describe some legal officials of Roman times . In the centuries from the Tudor period until the onset of the Industrial Revolution , the JPs constituted a major element of the English ( later British ) governmental system , which had been termed sometimes squirearchy ( i.e. , dominance of the land - owning gentry ) . For example , historian Tim Blanning notes that while in Britain the royal prerogative was decisively curbed by the Bill of Rights 1689 , in practice the central government in London had a greater ability to get its policies implemented in the rural outlying regions than could contemporary absolute monarchies such as France -- a paradox due especially to JPs belonging to the same social class as the Members of Parliament and thus having a direct interest in getting laws actually enforced and implemented on the ground . Being an unpaid office , undertaken voluntarily and sometimes more for the sake of renown or to confirm the justice 's standing within the community , the justice was typically a member of the gentry . The justices of the peace conducted arraignments in all criminal cases , and tried misdemeanours and infractions of local ordinances and bylaws . Towns and boroughs with enough burdensome judicial business that could not find volunteers for the unpaid role of justice of the peace had to petition the Crown for authority to hire a paid stipendiary magistrate . The Municipal Corporations Act 1835 stripped the power to appoint normal JPs from those municipal corporations that had it . This was replaced by the present system , where the Lord Chancellor nominates candidates with local advice , for appointment by the Crown . Until the introduction of elected county councils in the 19th century , JPs , in quarter sessions , also administered the county at a local level . They fixed wages , regulated food supplies , built and controlled roads and bridges , and undertook to provide and supervise locally those services mandated by the Crown and Parliament for the welfare of the county . Women were not allowed to become JPs in the United Kingdom until 1919 , the first woman being Ada Summers , the Mayor of Stalybridge , who was a JP ( Ex officio ) by virtue of her office . In October 1920 Ada was appointed a JP officially , alongside other pioneers like Miriam Lightowler OBE in Halifax Emily Murphy of Edmonton , Canada , preceded her by some three and a half years . Now in the UK , 50 % of JPs are women . In special circumstances , a justice of the peace can be the highest governmental representative , so in fact ' gubernatorial ' , in a colonial entity . This was the case in the Tati Concessions Land , a gold - mining concession ( territory ) in the Matabele kingdom , until its annexation by the British Bechuanaland protectorate . See also : Magistrates ' court ( Russia ) Modern use ( edit ) Australia ( edit ) A justice of the peace in Australia is typically someone of good stature in the community who is authorised to witness and sign statutory declarations and affidavits and to certify copies of original documents . Criteria for appointment vary widely , depending on the state . Queensland ( edit ) In the state of Queensland , a `` justice of the peace ( qualified ) '' has the additional powers to issue search warrants and arrest warrants and , in conjunction with another justice of the peace ( qualified ) constitute a magistrates ' court for exercising powers to remand defendants in custody , grant bail , and adjourn court hearings . Some justices are appointed as justice of the peace ( magistrates ' court ) , usually in remote aboriginal communities , to perform many of the functions that might otherwise fall to a stipendiary magistrate . In Queensland , a lawyer may be appointed as a Justice of the Peace without further education or qualification and has the full powers of a JP ( Magistrate 's Court ) . A commissioner for declarations ( C. dec ) has powers limited to witnessing documents , witnessing statutory declarations , witnessing affidavits , witnessing and administering oaths and affirmations . The first woman to become a JP in Queensland was Matilda ( Maud ) Hennessey of Mackay on 24 April 1918 . Victoria ( edit ) Justices of the peace and bail justices , who are also volunteers , are appointed to serve a semi-judicial function in all areas of the Victorian community . The main official roles in the Victorian community include witnessing statutory declarations , witnessing affidavits and hearing bail matters outside court hours ( bail justices only ) . The first woman to become a JP in Victoria was Mary Catherine Rogers who , in 1920 , became the first woman councillor in Australia when she was elected in the City of Richmond . Justices of the peace ( JPs ) provide a service to the community as independent witnesses of statutory declarations , powers of attorney and affidavits . JPs , who are also volunteers , are selected through an extensive interview , written exam and practical testing . They are recommended by the state attorney - general and appointed by the governor - in - council , and it is their job to authorise and witness statutory declarations and affidavits within the state of Victoria . There are currently around 4,800 JPs serving in all areas of the state . Bail justices ( edit ) The role of a bail justice is to hear bail applications ( under the Bail Act 1977 ) and to hear applications for interim accommodation orders for children ( under the Children and Young Persons Act 1989 ) within Victoria . Bail justices , once appointed , may remain in their role until they turn 70 years of age ( although they must be under 65 at the time of their appointment ) . They are often required to attend call outs and rule on bail applications or protection applications for children in danger on weekends and late at night when the courts are closed , but they can also witness Victorian statutory declarations and affidavits . Candidates must successfully complete a three - day training course run by the Department of Justice . Bail justices , who are also volunteers , also have some limited powers under federal legislation , including the power to conduct interstate extradition hearings and extending question time for federal police . Bail Justices may use the post-nominals BJ after their names . New South Wales ( edit ) The most common functions performed by a justice of the peace in New South Wales are to witness the signing of a statutory declaration , witness the signing of an affidavit and certify that a copy of an original document is a true copy . JPs are appointed by the Governor of New South Wales for five - year terms . They are volunteers , who come from all walks of life and all sections of the community . JPs are people who are trusted to be honest , careful and impartial when performing the functions of a JP . They must not charge a fee or accept a gift for providing JP services , tell people what to write in a statutory declaration or affidavit or write it for them or give them legal advice . Ways to find a JP in New South Wales include : 1 . Search the JP Public Register . The register lists all JPs for each postcode area and provides a telephone contact number for JPs who serve the community directly . 2 . Check a public listing of scheduled JP services to find when JPs are available at scheduled times and locations across the state . South Australia ( edit ) In South Australia , there are two types of justices : justice of the peace and special justices . A justice of the peace ( JP ) in South Australia is typically someone of good stature in the community who is authorised to witness and sign statutory declarations , affidavits , waiver rights , search warrants , drug warrants , divorce documents , and to certify copies of original documents and to witness the signing of power of attorney and guardianship documents , providing the JP is satisfied with the capability of the signatory . A Special Justice ( SJ ) is a higher level of justice of the peace in South Australia ; they sit on the bench of the magistrates ' court hearing cases in the petty sessions division . The South Australian Attorney - General has set up a web site to locate justices of the peace . The majority of metropolitan and many regional Councils ( Local Government authorities ) have a rotational justice of the peace in residence at nominated times . Western Australia ( edit ) Justices of the peace in Western Australia are appointed by the Governor who authorises them to carry out a wide range of official administrative and judicial duties in the community . As well as presiding in the Magistrates Court , justices of the peace are regularly called upon by the WA Police to sign search warrants and authorise the issuing of summonses . The administrative tasks include witnessing affidavits and documents such as wills and statutory declarations . ' Visiting justices ' are a special group of justices of the peace , appointed to preside over cases within the prison system . Belgium ( edit ) In Belgium , the justice of the peace ( French : juge de paix , Dutch : vrederechter ) is a law - trained judge who sits the lowest Court of record with original jurisdiction over small claims ( less than € 2500 ) matters of civil , commercial , and family law , including : tenancy and lease disputes , neighborhood disputes ( party structures , trespassing , noise pollution ) , apartment buildings , small deceased estates , alimony , guardianships & adoption , and the commitment of mental patients and oversight of their care . Litigants may opt either for conciliation or trial . Lawyers may act as locum tenens JPs . Canada ( edit ) In Canada , justices of the peace play a role in the administration of justice at the provincial level . Justices are generally appointed by the lieutenant governors of Canada 's provinces , and by the commissioners of Canada 's territories , on the advice of their relevant premier or Attorney General . Canada made the first appointment in the then British Empire of a woman as a magistrate , namely Emily Murphy , who was sworn in as a police magistrate in the Women 's Court of the City of Edmonton ( Alberta ) on 19 June 1916 . British Columbia ( edit ) In British Columbia , pursuant to the Provincial Court Act , all judges are justices of the peace , and hence all of them are peace officers . Northwest Territories ( edit ) In the Northwest Territories , justices may hear summary conviction matters , municipal by - laws , and certain criminal matters . However , in more populated provinces justices usually preside over bail hearings and provincial offences courts . When not in a court session , a justice can perform other judicial functions , such as issuing search warrants . Ontario ( edit ) In Ontario , justices perform a wide variety of duties related to criminal and regulatory law , at the federal , provincial and municipal levels . Ontario JP wear a green sash versus red worn by judges . Quebec ( edit ) In Quebec , there are two type of justices of the peace , administrative justice of the peace and presiding justice of the peace . Administrative justice of the peace are court officers appointed by the Minister of Justice , and perform duties such as receiving criminal informations and issuing warrants . Presiding justice of the peace are appointed by commission under the Great Seal , and can try some criminal matters and issue warrants . They are appointed from advocates of at least ten years ' standing and serve full - time until the age of 70 . Yukon ( edit ) In Yukon , justices of the peace are lay officers of the court . They sit in the Justice of the Peace Court , which is part of the Territorial Court of Yukon . Hong Kong ( edit ) In Hong Kong , the historical functions of justices of the peace have been replaced by full - time , legally qualified magistrates . Nowadays , justices of the peace are essentially titles of honour given by the Government to community leaders , and to certain officials while they are in their terms of offices . They have no judicial functions , and their main duties include visiting prisons , institutions for young offenders and drug addicts , psychiatric hospitals , remand homes , places of refuge , reception and detention centres , administering statutory declarations , and serving as members of advisory panels . India ( edit ) In India , justices of the peace do exist , but they no longer occupy a prominent post . One of the famous justices in India was Kavasji Jamshedji Petigara . Maharaja Prabirendra Mohan Tagore son of Maharaja Sir Prodyut Kumar Tagore KCSI of Calcutta was designated Justice of the Peace in 1932 . He played a great part in saving more than 200 Muslim lives during the infamous riots in 1947 during the partition of India , by sheltering the Muslims in the Calcutta locality and most importantly in his palace itself . Ireland ( edit ) Justices of the peace existed in Ireland prior to 1922 , sitting in a bench under the supervision of resident magistrates at petty sessions to try minor offences summarily , and with a county court judge ( in his capacity of chairman of quarter sessions ) and jury to try more serious offences at quarter sessions . In the Irish Free State the position was effectively abolished by the District Justices ( Temporary Provisions ) Act 1923 and permanently abolished by the Courts of Justice Act 1924 . Their judicial powers were replaced by full - time , legally qualified district justices ( now called district judges ) and their quasi-judicial powers by lay Peace Commissioners . Peace commissioners may sign statutory declarations , and may issue summons and search warrants to the Garda Síochána ( Irish police ) . A Peace Commissioner can not sign an Affidavit , in Ireland that function is performed by a Commissioner for Oaths . Jamaica ( edit ) A justice of the peace ( JP ) , according to the Ministry of Justice , is a person of unquestionable integrity who seeks to promote and protect the rights of the individual and helps to provide justice to persons in a particular community . Additionally , the JP serves as a justice in petty court sessions , attends juvenile court sessions , issues summonses , considers applications for bail , explains and signs legal documents , sits on licensing panels , and gives counsel / advice . Any Jamaican citizen that can speak and write English is eligible to become a JP . Any club / organisation / citizen can recommend someone to become JP for a community . JPs are chosen under the Governor - General 's discretion . Malaysia ( edit ) In Malaysia , justices of the peace have largely been replaced in magistrates ' courts by legally qualified ( first - class ) stipendiary magistrates . However , state governments continue to appoint justices of the peace as honours . In 2004 , some associations of justices of the peace pressed the federal government to allow justices of the peace to sit as second - class magistrates in order to reduce the backlog of cases in the courts . New Zealand ( edit ) A Justice of the Peace in New Zealand is someone of good stature in the community who is authorized to witness and sign statutory declarations and affidavits as well as certify documents . They may also perform citizenship ceremonies and act as a Visiting Justice in prisons the function of which is to record a prisoner 's grievance and decide on its validity . They have certain powers to issue search warrants , and ( in conjunction with another justice of the peace ) may try minor criminal trials in the district court and exercise powers to remand defendants in custody , grant bail , and adjourn court hearings . They are nominated for office by local Members of Parliament and appointed by the Governor General . Appointment is for life and a JP must take the Oath of Allegiance and the Judicial Oath . Pakistan ( edit ) Sections 22 , 22 - A and 22 - B of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code , 1898 provide for the appointment of justices of the peace by the provincial governments , their powers and duties respectively . However , seldom are justices of the peace appointed in Pakistan outside the judiciary . Session and additional session judges act as ex-officio justices of the peace as per Section 25 of the Code of Criminal Procedure , 1898 . An Ex-officio Justice of the Peace may issue appropriate directions to the police authorities concerned on a complaint regarding - ( i ) non-registration of a criminal case ; ( ii ) transfer of investigation from one police officer to another ; and ( iii ) neglect , failure or excess committed by a police authority in relation to its functions and duties . Such functions being quasi-judicial in nature could not be termed as executive , administrative or ministerial. ( PLD 2016 Supreme Court 581 ) It is pertinent to note however , as many academics have pointed out , that there is great utility in the appointment of such justices especially in rural areas where enmity between rival groups can lead to the inability of registration of cognizable offences and biased judicial proceedings . Singapore ( edit ) A justice of the peace in Singapore derives his powers from statute law . He is appointed by the President of the Republic of Singapore , under the provisions of section 11 ( l ) of the Subordinate Courts Act ( Cap. 321 ) . The President may revoke the appointment of any justice of the peace . A newly appointed justice of the peace is required by section 17 of the Subordinate Courts Act , to take the oath of office and allegiance as set out in the schedule to the Subordinate Courts Act , before exercising the functions of his office . In their role , JPs serve as visiting justices of Singapore prisons , mediators or referees in the subordinate courts . They may also solemnise marriages in the Registry of Marriages or perform the duties of the magistrate conferred on them by any written law . Sri Lanka ( edit ) In Sri Lanka , Justice of the Peace ( JP ) is an honorary post , with authorization to witness and sign statutory declarations and affidavits . Persons appointed as a Justice of the Peace may use the post-nominal JP . Current appointments are made under the Judicature Act No 02 of 1978 , by the Minister of Justice at his / her discretion by publishing a list in the Gazette and appointee taking oaths before a high court , district court judge or magistrate with registrar of the supreme court recording it . Any citizen of Sri Lanka can apply to the Ministry of Justice giving his or her credentials to be appointed as a justice of the peace . However , the applicant should be one who has served the public and carries out social service and should be of good standing . The President of Sri Lanka and his / her officers are ex officio justices of the peace . A justice of the peace , who is an Attorney at law can be appointed as an unofficial magistrate . The post was introduced in the British colonial era , during which time appointments were made by the Governor until 1938 , after which appointments were made by the Legal Secretary until 1947 . After Ceylon gained its independence in 1948 , appointments were made by the Governor General and the Minister of Justice . Justice of the Peace had the power to administer oaths and affirmations per the Courts Ordinance No. 1 on 1889 section 84 and they could formally appoint members of the public to act as special police officers in times of turmoil and riots . Since certain government officers were ex-officio justices of the peace , this allowed British colonial officers to appoint special police officers from the European planters in times of crisies such as the 1915 riots . The Village Councils Law ( No. 6 of 1964 ) made the Chairman of the Village Council an ex officio justices of the peace for that village area . Tonga ( edit ) In 2014 , for the first time , Justices of the Peace were authorized in Tonga . JPs are appointed by the Crown , but the Lord Chief Justice regulates their duties and defines their powers . The first JPs were warranted with duties including granting bail ; issuing search warrants and subpoenas ; taking affidavits , declarations and oaths ; and having the power to witness documents . Term of office is one year and officials can be reappointed . The initial 19 JPs appointed were : ' Aisea Ta'ofi and Sione Hinakau of Niuatoputapu ; ' Inoke Tuaimei'api of Niuafo'ou ; Siosiua Hausia from ʻEua ; Sione Palu , Sione Fakahua , Me'ite Fukofuka and Kisione Taulani of Ha'apai ; Salesi Kauvaka , Viliami Pasikala , Haniteli Fa'anunu , Meli Taufaeteau and Moleni Taufa from Vava'u ; and Salote Fukofuka , ' Amelia Helu , ' Ofa Likiliki , Tevita Fakatou , Sioape Tu'iono and Semisi Tongia of Tongatapu .

They are advised on points of law and procedure by a legally qualified justices ' clerk and their assistants . No formal qualifications are required but magistrates need intelligence , common sense , integrity and the capacity to act fairly . Membership is widely spread throughout the local area and drawn from all walks of life following a rigorous selection process . All magistrates are carefully trained before sitting and continue to receive training throughout their service . Magistrates are unpaid volunteers but they may receive allowances to cover travelling expenses and subsistence . Lay justices or magistrates must sit for a minimum of 26 sessions ( half - days ) per year , but some sit as much as a day a week , or possibly more . Magistrates can sit alone to hear issues such as warrant applications or many traffic offences under the new Single Justice Procedure . In addition to the lay justices , there are a small number of district judges , formerly known as stipendiary magistrates . These are legally qualified , full - time members of the magistracy and hear cases alone , without any other magistrates on the bench . It is important to distinguish the district judge ( magistrates ' court ) from the district judges who usually sit in the county court . Magistrates ' courts today can deal with minor offences ( fines of up to £ 5,000 , or imprisonment of up to six months for a single offence or 12 months for consecutive sentences , or both ) and handle over 95 % of the criminal cases in England and Wales and Northern Ireland . With more serious offences , magistrates are responsible for indictment and committal to the Crown Court ( a task in former times dealt with by a grand jury ) . Magistrates also have a civil jurisdiction , such as a family jurisdiction . Although they had a licensing jurisdiction dealing liquor , betting and clubs licensing applications , this was transferred under the Licensing Act 2003 to local authorities . The magistrates now act in licensing matters only as an appeal court from the decisions of the local authority . Cardiff Magistrates ' Court is the only court in the country which deals with offences under the Companies Act , such as for late filing of accounts or directors ' offences . Westminster Magistrates ' Court has special responsibilities for dealing with all terrorism and extradition offences throughout the UK . Until the Courts Act 2003 came into force , magistrates were tied to a particular area ( see magistrates ' courts committee , commission area , petty sessions area ) . This has now been changed such that they are assigned to local justice areas , but less strongly . The Courts Act provides the current framework for appointment of the justices , which is done by the Lord Chancellor in the name of sovereign . Justices can also be removed by the same mechanism . District judges ( magistrates ' court ) -- previously known as stipendiary magistrates -- must have a seven years ' general legal qualification , and are appointed by the sovereign on the advice of the Lord Chancellor . Before 1714 , magistrates were liable to be approached at any time and in any place by people legally recognised as paupers , appealing for aid if parish authorities refused to provide any . It was relatively common for these magistrates to write out , on the spot , an order requiring aid to be granted . Scotland ( edit ) See also : Judiciary of Scotland Within the Scottish legal system justices of the peace are lay magistrates who currently sit in the justice of the peace courts . These courts were introduced in 2009 as a replacement for the district courts ( established in 1975 ) , which in turn replaced burgh police courts . Justices sit alone or in threes with a qualified legal assessor as convener or clerk of court . They handle many cases of breaches of the peace , drunkenness , minor assaults , petty theft , and offences under the Civic Government ( Scotland ) Act 1982 . The maximum sentencing power of a justice of the peace is 60 days imprisonment , or a fine up to £ 2,500 , or both , and the ability to disqualify drivers . In 2006 , the Scottish Government announced its intention to unify the management of the sheriff and district courts in Scotland , but retaining lay justices , as part of its initiative to create a unified judiciary under the Lord President . Following the passage of the Criminal Proceedings etc . ( Reform ) ( Scotland ) Act 2007 the justice of the peace courts were implemented on a sheriffdom - by - sheriffdom basis . In Glasgow , the volume of business required the employment of three solicitors as `` stipendiary magistrates '' who sat in place of the lay justices . The stipendiary magistrates ' court had the same sentencing power as the summary sheriff court in summary proceedings , which was the ability to sentence an offender to up to 1 year in prison or fine them up to £ 10,000 . Stipendiary magistrates were replaced by summary sheriffs . Northern Ireland ( edit ) In Northern Ireland , the situation initially continued as it had in pre-1922 Ireland . However , justices of the peace no longer sat out of petty sessions after 1935 ( Summary Jurisdiction and Criminal Justice Act ( Northern Ireland ) 1935 ) . Since then , magistrates ' courts in Northern Ireland have consisted of legally qualified resident magistrates ( now known as district judges ( magistrates ' courts ) ) sitting alone , except in cases involving children , where two lay panelists sat with the magistrate . Justices of the peace were confined to the power to conduct committal hearings , bind persons over to the peace , sign warrants , summons , and other official documents . They were appointed by the Lord Chancellor on the recommendation of a committee in each county court division . The Justice ( Northern Ireland ) Act 2002 introduced a new office of lay magistrate , to sit alongside resident magistrates at magistrates ' courts in certain matters . Unlike in England and Wales , `` lay magistrate '' is the official title of the position , to distinguish from existing justices of the peace who do not sit in the magistrates ' courts . The first lay magistrates were appointed in 2005 . Two lay magistrates sit with the district judge ( magistrates ' court ) in criminal proceedings involving children ( replacing the former lay panelists ) and Family Proceedings Court matters . The district judge ( magistrates ' court ) , who is a barrister or solicitor of at least seven years standing , presides over the bench . Most criminal justice functions of JPs were transferred to lay magistrates . It is expected that there will be no further appointments of justices of the peace in Northern Ireland , although those already appointed retain the title and any functions not transferred to lay magistrate under the 2002 Act . United states ( edit ) In some US states , the justice of the peace is a judge of a court of limited jurisdiction , a magistrate , or a quasi-judicial official with certain statutory or common law magisterial powers . Some states have special qualifications or unique features for the office . The justice of the peace typically presides over a court that hears misdemeanor cases , traffic violations , and other petty criminal infractions . The justice of the peace may also have authority over cases involving small debts , landlord and tenant disputes , or other small claims court proceedings . Proceedings before justices of the peace are often faster and less formal than the proceedings in other courts . In some jurisdictions a party convicted or found liable before a justice of the peace may have the right to a trial de novo before the judge of a higher court rather than an appeal strictly considered . A justice of the peace also performs civil marriages . Arizona ( edit ) A justice of the peace has the same jurisdiction as a municipal magistrate with respect to traffic and misdemeanor cases and restraining orders , though over cases whose affairs are not contained within the confines of a single municipality . Additionally , the Justice Court hears cases involving county ordinances ( ordinances enacted by the board of supervisors that apply only to unincorporated areas ) , civil lawsuits up to a limit of $10,000 , small claims cases up to $2,500 , and issues evictions , called writs of restitution ( after a forcible detainer or special detainer action ( eviction ) being successfully completed by a landlord ) . Justices of the peace , also called JPs , or Judges of the Justice Court , are elected in partisan elections for four - year terms from specific districts called precincts . They have the same authority and responsibility as all other judges in the state with respect to performing marriages , administrating oaths , adhering to the code of judicial conduct , and all aspects of justice administration . However , Arizona law does not require justices of the peace to be lawyers . Many justices of the peace are not legally trained , although all are required by the Arizona Supreme Court to complete a course at the Arizona Judicial College . As with JPs , municipal judges in Arizona are not required to be lawyers . Arkansas ( edit ) This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( April 2013 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) In Arkansas , a justice of the peace is an elected official equivalent to a county commissioner or county supervisor in some other states . Arkansas JPs sit on a county quorum court , composed of 9 , 11 , 13 or 15 JPs . The quorum court is a part - time body , elected from single - member districts , that has overall responsibility for county affairs . Among their responsibilities are passing the budget , creating new ordinances ( at the misdemeanor level ) , setting property tax millage levels , and working with other elected officials . The full - time elected county administrator , who presides over the quorum court , is the county judge . Neither JPs nor the county judge have any judicial authority , though they do have the power to preside over civil marriages . Justices of the peace are elected every two years to these partisan offices . Massachusetts , Connecticut , Vermont ( edit ) Justices of the peace in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are often called on to perform marriages and , especially same - sex marriages , which certain religious officials are not willing to oversee . Justices of the peace in Connecticut can preside over same - sex marriages . Unlike Massachusetts , Connecticut JPs are not penalized for refusing to perform such ceremonies . Justices of the peace in Connecticut , Massachusetts , and Vermont have the same general oath - giving powers as a notary public . Louisiana Are elected to serve six year terms as the judicial authority of a ward or district . Have jurisdiction in civil matters when the amount in dispute does not exceed $5,000 . Do not have jurisdiction when a title to real estate is involved , when the state or any political subdivision is a defendant , or in successions or probate matters . Can perform marriage ceremonies Minnesota ( edit ) In Minnesota , the history of justices of the peace dates back hundreds of years to a time when they were considered to be some of the most powerful officials in terms of the authority that they had to influence change in a community . In modern times though , official justices of the peace are no longer present in Minnesota , but because of their history many current officials are still referred to as justices of the peace by a vast majority of Minnesotans . For example , while the authority to perform marriages in Minnesota was once reserved almost exclusively for justices of the peace , today that authority now lies with officials such as judges , court administrators , and ordained wedding officiants Nevertheless , it remains commonplace throughout the state for each of these types of officials to be referred to as a justice of the peace in the context of marriage . Another example of a current official who is often referred to as a justice of the peace is a notary public . Their responsibilities are largely related to acting as an official witness to an event , such as the signing of an important document , which is a responsibility that was once reserved for a justice of the peace . So while justices of the peace no longer exist in Minnesota in any official capacity , there are certainly some officials who can relate to being referred to as a justice of the peace simply due to the functions they perform . New York ( edit ) Justice courts are courts in New York State that handle traffic tickets , criminal matters , small claims and local code violations such as zoning . Though justice courts constitutionally are part of the New York State Unified Court System , state law generally makes justice courts independent of New York 's Office of Court Administration ( OCA ) and instead makes Justice Courts the responsibility of their sponsoring localities . Town justice courts are often called Town Court , and village justice courts are often called Village Court . City courts in New York State handle mostly the same types of cases but are not justice courts . The official title for judges in Justice Courts is Justice , the same as in New York Supreme Court . However , in common usage , most people , including lawyers , call them Judge . Justices in Justice Court do not have to be lawyers . The vast majority are not . Many of these courts are in small towns and villages where none of the residents are lawyers . In the larger towns , the justices are almost always lawyers . While Justices and their court clerks receive training from OCA , there is tremendous variability in how cases are handled . This includes court procedures and substantive results . Some courts will dismiss a traffic ticket if the officer does not appear for a trial , while others will adjourn the matter to give the officer another chance . In some courts the police prosecute their own tickets , while in others an Assistant District Attorney from the county or a town or village attorney will prosecute the tickets . This may even vary by the type of officer , with State Troopers and Deputies prosecuting their tickets and a town attorney prosecuting tickets written by the town police . Larger towns can have very busy caseloads , including several sessions a week with dozens of cases at each session , and people may have to wait hours before their cases are heard . In some small towns the caseload is extremely light , and a court might meet once a month and have only a few cases . All criminal prosecutions that occur in towns and villages are commenced in a justice court . Misdemeanors are handled exclusively in the justice court , while felonies generally move up to County Court before the case moves forward . Similar matters in some places outside New York are handled by a justice of the peace . Town and village Justices also possess limited powers of a New York Notary Public , ex-officio , only within the county in which the town or village for which they serve is located ; they may administer oaths and affirmations and take acknowledgments and proofs of execution . Some Justices seek and obtain a formal New York Notary Public commission to permit free travel state - wide and enjoy the additional privileges and international legal recognition of a notary public . New Hampshire ( edit ) New Hampshire justices of the peace are commissioned magisterial officers , appointed by the Governor and Executive Council to terms of five years , with the power to administer oaths , acknowledge instruments , perform marriage ceremonies and , effective January 1 , 2008 , solemnize civil unions for same - sex couples . They may also order compulsory mental examinations for good cause , act as a magisterial official regarding enforcement complaints on orders for isolation or quarantine issued by the Commissioner of Health and Human Services , administer oaths of office to public officials , take depositions and issue subpoenas . New Hampshire justices of the peace are also authorized , upon a showing of probable cause supported by affidavit , to issue arrest warrants , search warrants , administrative inspection warrants and by court appointment , to fix and receive bail in criminal cases . Texas ( edit ) In Texas , JP 's are elected on a partisan ballot every four years . Texas does not require a JP to be an attorney in good standing . However , JP 's are required to be `` well versed in the law '' and take mandatory classes to retain their office . New JP 's are required to take 80 hours of legal state mandated classes the first year , and 20 hours each year thereafter during their tenure in office . Sections 18 and 19 of Article V of the Texas Constitution , as well as Chapters 27 and 28 of the Texas Government Code , outline the duties of these Courts and their officers . Under Section 18 , the number of JP 's ( and associated constables ) is dependent on the size of the county : For counties with populations less than 18,000 ( as determined by the census ) , the entire county shall be one JP precinct , unless the Commissioners ' Court determines that more are needed , in which case the court can divide the county into no more than four JP precincts . For counties with populations at least 18,000 but less than 50,000 , the number of JP precincts shall be no less than two nor more than eight . For counties with populations 50,000 or greater , the number of JP precincts shall be no less than four nor more than eight . In any county with population less than 150,000 , if any precinct contains a city with 18,000 or more population , that precinct shall have two JP 's . In any county with population 150,000 or greater , each JP precinct may have more than one JP . Special provisions apply to Chambers and Randall counties ( must have no fewer than two nor more than six precincts ) and to Mills , Reagan , and Roberts ( the Constable office is abolished , with the Sheriff 's office performing all duties ) . Section 19 sets forth the minimum jurisdiction of the JP court : Original jurisdiction in `` criminal matters of misdemeanor cases punishable by fine only '' ( under the Texas Penal Code such offenses are called `` Class C '' misdemeanors , generally involving traffic offenses or public intoxication ; however , in jurisdictions with a municipal court , if the traffic offense is written by a municipal police officer the municipal court will have jurisdiction , whereas if the offense is written by a state or county officer the JP court will hear the case ) , Exclusive jurisdiction in `` civil matters where the amount in controversy is $200 or less '' , and `` Such other jurisdiction as may be provided by law '' . Under this provision , the Legislature has raised the top limit on civil matters to $10,000 and assigned the JP courts , among others , the right to hear cases involving eviction as well as cases involving foreclosure and liens against personal property where the amount falls within the ( revised ) JP Court 's jurisdiction . JP cases are appealed to the county court level ; the appeal results in a trial de novo . In criminal cases , cases beginning in justice court can not be appealed beyond the county level court unless the fine is more than $100 or a constitutional matter is asserted . In smaller counties without a coroner , the JP has the duty to perform inquests . The JP is also called out for any unattended deaths in the county . A JP in a large precinct in a large county will work 5 days a week , 8 or more hours daily . Their duties will include , but are not necessarily limited to the following : Trials of civil matters , both to a 6 - person jury and to the bench , with an amount in controversy not exceeding $10,000.00 . Trials of criminal matters involving traffic violations and class C misdemeanors punishable by fine only . Pre-trial motion dockets and show cause hearings are held , and all discovery must be approved by the Judge in advance in civil cases . All criminal matters are controlled by the rules of criminal procedure and evidence . A much more restricted and smaller set of rules apply in civil matters unless in the Judges discretion , it is believed to be in the best interests of justice to apply the standard rules of evidence and procedure . The court has the exclusive jurisdiction of evictions . A Texas JP Judge will also magistrate prisoners and set bail . The Judge will hear juvenile violations such as truancy , and underage drinking and smoking . Warrants of Arrest , Alias , Search and Capias Profine are issued . Protective Orders can issue and result in jail time if violated . Several administrative matters are heard including the finding of a Dangerous Dog , Occupational Drivers License and tow hearings . Many writs are issued such as writs of re-entry to apartments , possession of realty and to reinstate utilities a landlord may have turned off . A JP has contempt power of $100 and up to 3 days in jail per occurrence . A JP is also authorized to perform marriage ceremonies . Replacement with other courts ( edit ) In many states , the office of justice of the peace has been abolished or transferred to another court , such as the magistrate court . In larger cities , cases may be heard in a municipal court which has jurisdiction only within that city . Most efforts to abolish the office of justice of the peace have been led by the American Bar Association , which views non-lawyer judges as no longer necessary , as there are now far more persons with formal legal education than in the past when justices of the peace were first used . California formerly had justice of the peace courts staffed by lay judges , but began phasing them out after a landmark 1974 decision in which the Supreme Court of California unanimously held that it was a violation of federal due process ( under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution ) to allow a non-lawyer to preside over a criminal trial which could result in incarceration of the defendant . The court specifically recognized that in the aftermath of Gideon v. Wainwright ( 1963 ) , it made no sense to allow a case to be tried before a layperson incapable of understanding the legal arguments of the attorney to whom the defendant was entitled under Gideon . The remaining justice courts ( as well as municipal courts ) were eliminated by the passage of Proposition 220 in June 1998 , which merged all lower courts within the state judicial branch into the superior courts ( the courts of general jurisdiction ) . Under current California law , all California judges must be licensed attorneys . Notably , the Supreme Court of the United States sharply disagreed with California 's analysis of the Fourteenth Amendment in the landmark case of North v. Russell , 427 U.S. 328 ( 1976 ) , in which the court held that Kentucky 's use of nonlawyer judges in its police courts was not a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees of due process and equal protection of the laws .

It has in fact , inherited the legacy of the legal system established by the then colonial powers and the princely states since the mid-19th century , and has partly retained characteristics of practices from the ancient and medieval times . There are various levels of judiciary in India -- different types of courts , each with varying powers depending on the tier and jurisdiction bestowed upon them . They form a strict hierarchy of importance , in line with the order of the courts in which they sit , with the Supreme Court of India at the top , followed by High Courts of respective states with district judges sitting in District Courts and Magistrates of Second Class and Civil Judge ( Junior Division ) at the bottom . Class Rank Chief Justice Of High Court First Additional Justice / Registrar General Second Subordinate Justice Third District Judge Fourth Additional District Judge Fifth Special Judge Sixth Session / Criminal Judge Seventh Sub - Divisional Magistrate Eighth Chief Judicial Magistrate Ninth Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Tenth Civil Judge ( Senior Division ) Eleventh Secretary Magistrate Twelfth Judicial Magistrate Thirteenth Judge ( Junior Division ) Fourteenth Contents ( hide ) 1 The Constitution and the Judiciary 1.1 Appointment and Transfer of Judges at Present 2 Courts 2.1 Supreme Court of India 2.2 High courts 2.3 District courts 2.4 Village courts 3 Issues 3.1 Pendency of cases 3.2 Judicial corruption 4 Reform 4.1 E-Courts Mission Mode Project 4.1. 1 Judicial Service Centre 5 History 5.1 Jury trial 6 See also 7 References 8 Further reading The Constitution and the judiciary ( edit ) The JUDICIARY interprets the Constitution as its final arbiter . It is its duty as mandated by the Constitution , to be its watchdog , by calling for scrutiny any act of the legislature or the executive , who otherwise , are free to enact or implement these , from overstepping bounds set for them by the Constitution . It acts like a guardian in protecting the fundamental rights of the people , as enshrined in the Constitution , from infringement by any organ of the state . It also balances the conflicting exercise of power between the centre and a state or among states , as assigned to them by the Constitution . While pronouncing decisions under its constitutional mandate , it is expected to remain unaffected by pulls and pressures exerted by other branches of the state , citizens or interest groups . And crucially , independence of the judiciary has been held to be a basic feature of the Constitution , and which being inalienable , has come to mean -- that which can not be taken away from it by any act or amendment by the legislature or the executive . This independence shows up in the following manner : No minister , or even the executive collectively , can suggest any names for appointment as judges , to the President , who ultimately decides on appointing them from a list of names recommended only by the collegium of the judiciary . Nor can judges of the Supreme Court or a High Court be removed from office once appointed , unless an overwhelming two - thirds of members of any of the Houses of the Parliament back the move , and only on grounds of proven misconduct or incapacity . A person who has been a judge of a court is debarred from practicing in the jurisdiction of that court . The constitution and hence judiciary need continued review to ensure they do n't lose relevance , with the present and are kept in synch with the changing times . The judiciary , in India ( and the world over ) is making efforts to computerize and hence e-courts and e-judiciary but this will require a rethink and re-packaging of judiciary for maximum benefits from available judicial resources , i.e. judges , jury ... E-courts In India Appointment and transfer of judges at present ( edit ) As per the Constitution , as held by the court in the Three Judges ' Cases -- ( 1982 , 1993 , 1998 ) , a judge is appointed to the Supreme Court and the High Courts by the President of India from a list of names recommended by the collegium -- a closed group of the Chief Justice of India and the senior-most judges of the Supreme Court , for appointments to the Supreme Court , and they , together with the Chief Justice of a High Court and its senior-most judges , for appointments to that court . This has resulted in a Memorandum of Procedure being followed , for the appointments . Judges used to be appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Union Cabinet . After 1993 , as held in the Second Judges ' Case , the executive was given the power to reject a name recommended by the judiciary . However , according to some , the executive has not been diligent in using this power to reject the names of bad candidates recommended . The collegium system has come under a fair amount of criticism . Presently , by a recent order in the Fourth Judges ' Case , the court has invited everyone , including the public , to suggest by mid-November 2015 , how to improve it , broadly along the lines of -- setting up an eligibility criteria for appointments , a permanent secretariat to help the collegium sift through material on potential candidates , infusing more transparency into the selection process , grievance redressal and any other suggestion not in these four categories , like transfer of judges . Earlier , one recommendation by a collegium came to be challenged in court . The court held that who could become a judge was a matter of fact , and any person had a right to question it . But who should become a judge was a matter of opinion and could not be questioned . As long as an effective consultation took place within a collegium in arriving at that opinion , the content or material placed before it to form the opinion could not be called for scrutiny in a court . Courts ( edit ) Supreme Court of India ( edit ) Main article : Supreme Court of India The Supreme Court is the highest court of the country or nation , which is established by the Constitution . According to it , the Supreme Court is a federal court , guardian of the Constitution and the highest court of appeal . Articles 124 to 147 of the Constitution lay down the composition and jurisdiction of the Court . Primarily , it is an appellate court which takes up appeals against judgments of the High Courts of the states and territories . However , it also takes writ petitions in cases of serious human rights violations or any petition filed under Article 32 which is the right to constitutional remedies or if a case involves a serious issue that needs immediate resolution . It had its inaugural sitting on 26 January 1950 , the day India 's constitution came into force , and since then has delivered more than 24,000 reported judgements . The Supreme Court comprises the Chief Justice and 30 other Judges . The proceedings of the Supreme Court are conducted in English only . Supreme Court Rules , 1966 are framed under Article 145 of the Constitution to regulate the practice and procedure of the Supreme Court . The same is amended and presently governed by the Supreme Court Rules , 2013. ( http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/Supreme%20Court%20Rules,%202013.pdf ) High courts ( edit ) Main article : List of High Courts of India There are 24 High Courts at the State level . Article 141 of the Constitution of India mandates that they are bound by the judgements and orders of the Supreme Court of India by precedence . These courts have jurisdiction over a state , a union territory or a group of states and union territories . Below the High Courts are a hierarchy of subordinate courts such as the civil courts , family courts , criminal courts and various other district courts . High courts are instituted as constitutional courts under Part VI , Chapter V , Article 214 of the Indian Constitution . The High Courts are the principal civil courts of original jurisdiction in the state along with District Courts which are subordinate to the High courts . However , High courts exercise their original civil and criminal jurisdiction only if the courts subordinate to the high court in the state are not competent ( not authorised by law ) to try such matters for lack of pecuniary , territorial jurisdiction . High courts may also enjoy original jurisdiction in certain matters if so designated specifically in a state or Federal law . e.g. : Company law cases are instituted only in a high court . However , primarily the work of most High Courts consists of Appeals from lower courts and writ petitions in terms of Article 226 of the Constitution of India . Writ Jurisdiction is also original jurisdiction of High Court . The precise territorial jurisdiction of each High Court varies Judges in a high court are appointed by the President after consultation with the Chief Justice of India , Chief Justice of High Court and the governor of the state . The number of judges in a court is decided by dividing the average institution of main cases during the last five years by the national average , or the average rate of disposal of main cases per judge per year in that High Court , whichever is higher . The Calcutta High Court is the oldest High Court in the country , established on 2 July 1862 , whereas the Allahabad High Court is the largest , having a sanctioned strength of judges at 160 . High courts which handle a large number of cases of a particular region , have permanent benches ( or a branch of the court ) established there . For litigants of remote regions , ' circuit benches ' are set up , which work for those days in a month when judges visit . District courts ( edit ) Main article : District Courts The District Courts are established by the State governments of India for every district or for one or more districts together taking into account the number of cases , population distribution in the district . They administer justice in India at a district level . These courts are under administrative control of the High Court of the State to which the district concerned belongs . The decisions of District court are subject to the appellate jurisdiction of the concerned High court . The district court is presided over by one District Judge appointed by the state Government . In addition to the district judge there may be number of Additional District Judges and Assistant District Judges depending on the workload . The Additional District Judge and the court presided have equivalent jurisdiction as the District Judge and his district court . The district judge is also called `` Metropolitan session judge '' when he is presiding over a district court in a city which is designated `` Metropolitan area '' by the state Government . The district court has appellate jurisdiction over all subordinate courts situated in the district on both civil and criminal matters . Subordinate courts , on the civil side ( in ascending order ) are , Junior Civil Judge Court , Principal Junior Civil Judge Court , Senior Civil Judge Court ( also called sub-court ) . Subordinate courts , on the criminal side ( in ascending order ) are , Second Class Judicial Magistrate Court , First Class Judicial Magistrate Court , Chief Judicial Magistrate Court.In addition ' Family Courts '' are established to deal with matrimonial disputes alone . The Principal judge of family court is equivalent to District Judge . Village courts ( edit ) Village courts , called Lok Adalat ( people 's court ) or Nyaya panchayat ( justice of the villages ) , compose a system of alternative dispute resolution . They were recognized through the 1888 Madras Village Court Act , then developed ( after 1935 ) in various provinces and ( after 1947 ) Indian states . The model from the Gujarat State ( with a judge and two assessors ) was used from the 1970s onwards . In 1984 the Law Commission recommended to create Nyaya Panchayats in rural areas with laymen ( `` having educational attainments '' ) . The 2008 Gram Nyayalayas Act had foreseen 5,000 mobile courts in the country for judging petty civil ( property cases ) and criminal ( up to 2 years of prison ) cases . However , the Act has not been enforced properly , with only 151 functional Gram Nyayalayas in the country ( as of May 2012 ) against a target of 5000 such courts . The major reasons behind the non-enforcement includes financial constraints , reluctance of lawyers , police and other government officials . Issues ( edit ) This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( June 2012 ) According to the World Bank , `` although India 's courts are notoriously inefficient , they at least comprise a functioning independent judiciary '' A functioning judiciary is the guarantor of fairness and a powerful weapon against corruption . But people 's experiences fall far short of this ideal . Corruption in the judiciary goes beyond the bribing of judges . Court personnel are paid off to slow down or speed up a trial , or to make a complainant go away . Citizens are often unaware of their rights , or resigned , after so many negative experiences , to their fate before an inefficient court . Court efficiency is also crucial , as a serious backlog of cases creates opportunities for demanding unscheduled payments to fast - track a case . Indian Judiciary Issues have been depicted in several films , one of them being a 2015 , Marathi film , Court . I think the biggest challenge is exploiting the available resources in judiciary to be most effective -- ie the high complexity cases getting the maximum and best judicial treatment and low priority matters the least judicial service , and since there is a drift towards e-judiciary , E-courts In India exploiting the power of computers and associated computing tools -- logic , algorithm , trend analysis -- to service these matters -- in which patterns and repetition can be identified and hence can be solved by generically Pendency of cases ( edit ) Indian courts have millions of pending cases . On an average about 20 % of the sanctioned positions for judges are vacant , whereas the annual increase in pendency is less than 2 % . If the vacancies were filled , pendencies would go down and make the justice system deliver efficiently . Traffic challans , police challans and cheque bounce cases make up nearly half of all pending cases . In 2015 , it was reported that there were close to 400 vacancies for judge 's post in country 's 24 high courts . Arrears in the Supreme Court have mounted to around 65,000 . There are some 30 million cases in various courts . Budget allocation for judiciary is a miserly 0.2 per cent of the gross domestic product . The judge - population ratio is 10.5 to one million , which should be 50 to one million . The government has been the largest , single party litigating before the courts , and has kept adding cases to the over-burdened courts despite losing most , and then on losing , has relentlessly taken them to the next court , much of this being avoidable , according to the Law Commission The vast number of cases pending in the Supreme Court as well as the other lower courts has defeated the very purpose of the judicial system . For justice delayed , is in effect justice denied . Judiciary is no longer attracting the best legal talent because of disparity in the income of bright young lawyers and the emoluments of judicial officers . In order to attract persons of the right caliber to the judicial cadre , System must improve their service conditions , particularly of the trial court judges . In recent years scandals about lack of integrity have besmirched the reputation of the judiciary . The sub-ordinate judiciary works in appalling conditions . Any reform undertaken must be in its totality rather than in isolation . On 12 January 2012 , a Supreme Court bench said that people 's faith in judiciary was decreasing at an alarming rate , posing a grave threat to constitutional and democratic governance of the country . It acknowledged some of the serious problems of a large number of vacancies in trial courts , unwillingness of lawyers to become judges , and the failure of the apex judiciary in filling vacant HC judges posts . It wanted to seek answers from the government on amicus curiae 's suggestion that access to justice must be made a constitutional right and consequently the executive must provide necessary infrastructure for ensuring every citizen enjoyed this right . It also wanted the Government of India to detail the work being done by the National Mission for Justice Delivery and Legal Reforms . Undertrials outnumber convicts in the prison population of Indian jails . There have been cases where ordinary citizens have been charged for espionage while overstaying their visa or straying across the international land or maritime boundary and languishing in prison for years due to the slow redressal process . To reduce pendency , ' Fast - track courts ' , ' Evening courts / Morning courts ' were set up and have met with mixed success so far . ' Mobile courts ' are being set up to bring ' justice at the doorsteps ' of litigants of far - flung remote and backward rural areas . However , Lok Adalats an informal , alternative mechanism has been a phenomenal success in tackling pendency , especially in pre-litigation matters , settling fresh cases before they become full - blown disputes and enter the courts . Judicial corruption ( edit ) Corruption is rampant in India 's courts . According to Transparency International , judicial corruption in India is attributable to factors such as `` delays in the disposal of cases , shortage of judges and complex procedures , all of which are exacerbated by a preponderance of new laws '' . Most disturbing is the fact that corruption has reached the highest judicial forum i.e. Supreme Court of India . Some notable cases include : In December 2009 , legal activist and Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan stated in court , `` out of the last 16 to 17 Chief Justices , half have been corrupt '' In November 2010 , former Law Minister , Shanti Bhushan echoed Prashant Bhushan 's claim . There have been allegations that judges with doubtful integrity were elevated within the higher judiciary and campaigns held for their impeachment . In November 2011 , a former Supreme Court Justice Ruma Pal slammed the higher judiciary for what she called the seven sins . She listed the sins as : Turning a blind eye to the injudicious conduct of a colleague Hypocrisy -- the complete distortion of the norm of judicial independence Secrecy -- the fact that no aspect of judicial conduct including the appointment of judges to the High and Supreme Court is transparent Plagiarism and prolixity -- meaning that very often SC judges lift whole passages from earlier decisions by their predecessors and do not acknowledge this -- and use long - winded , verbose language Self Arrogance -- wherein the higher judiciary has claimed crass superiority and independence to mask their own indiscipline and transgression of norms and procedures Professional arrogance -- whereby judges do not do their homework and arrive at decisions of grave importance ignoring precedent or judicial principle Nepotism -- wherein favors are sought and dispensed by some judges for gratification of varying manner . In 2011 , Soumitra Sen , former judge at the Calcutta High Court became the first judge in the India to be impeached by the Rajya Sabha for misappropriation of funds . Reform ( edit ) This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( June 2012 ) E-courts Mission mode project ( edit ) Main article : E-courts In India The E-courts project was established in the year 2005 . According to the project , all the courts including taluk courts will get computerised . As per the project in 2008 , all the District courts were initialised under the project .

History ( edit ) Jury trial ( edit ) The first jury trial decided by an English jury in India happened in Madras ( now Chennai ) in 1665 , for which Ascentia Dawes ( probably a British woman ) was charged by a grand jury with the murder of her slave girl , and a petty jury , with six Englishmen and six Portuguese , found her not guilty . With the development of the East India Company empire in India , the jury system was implemented inside a dual system of courts : In Presidency Towns ( Calcutta , Madras , Bombay ) , there were Crown Courts and in criminal cases juries had to judge British and European people ( as a privilege ) and in some cases Indian people ; and in the territories outside the Presidency Towns ( called `` moffussil '' ) , there were Company Courts ( composed with Company officials ) without jury to judge most of the cases implying indigenous people . After the Crown Government of India ( Raj ) adopted the Indian Penal Code ( 1860 ) and the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure ( 1861 , amended in 1872 , 1882 , 1898 ) , the criminal jury was obligatory only in the High Courts of the Presidency Towns ; elsewhere , it was optional and rarely used . According sections 274 and 275 of the Code of Criminal Procedure , the jury was composed from 3 ( for smaller offences judged in session courts ) to 9 ( for severe offences judges in High Courts ) men ; and when the accused were British and European , at least half of the jurors had to be British and European men . The jury found no place in the 1950 Indian Constitution , and it was ignored in many Indian states . The Law Commission recommended its abolition in 1958 in its 14th Report . Jury trials were abolished in India by a very discrete process during the 1960s , finishing with the 1973 Code of Criminal Procedure , which is still in force today . Without any proper study comparing existing judicial systems and without any effort to improve the system , it was claimed that the 8 : 1 acquittal of Kawas Nanavati in K.M. Nanavati v. State of Maharashtra , which was overturned by higher courts on the grounds that the jury was misled by the presiding judge and were susceptible to media and public influence , was the reason . A study by Elisabeth Kolsky argues that many `` perverse verdicts '' were delivered by white juries in trial of `` European British subjects '' charged with murder , assault , confinement of Indians .

It was designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker , who were responsible for planning and construction of New Delhi by British government . The construction of buildings took six years and the opening ceremony was performed on 18 January 1927 by the then Viceroy and Governor - General of India , Irwin . The construction costs for the building were ₹ 8.3 million ( US $130,000 ) . The parliament is 560 feet ( 170 m ) in diameter and covers an area of 6 acres ( 2.4 ha ) . The Central hall consists of the chambers of Lok sabha , Rajya Sabha and the Library hall . Surrounding these three chambers is the four storied circular structure providing accommodations for members and houses Parliamentary committees , offices and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs . General layout of the building ( edit ) The centre and the focus of the building is the Central Hall . It consists of chambers of Lok Sabha , Rajya Sabha and the Library Hall and between them lie garden courts . Surrounding these three chambers is the four storyed circular structure providing accommodations for Ministers , Chairmen , Parliamentary committees , Party offices , important offices of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Secretariats and also the offices of the ministry of Parliamentary affairs . The Central Hall is circular in shape and the dome is 98 feet ( 29.87 meters ) in diameter . It is a place of historical importance . The Indian Constitution was framed in the Central Hall . The Central Hall was originally used in the library of erstwhile Central Legislative Assembly and the Council of States . In 1946 , it was converted and refurbished into Constituent Assembly Hall . At present , the Central Hall is used for holding joint sittings of both the houses of parliament and also used for address by the President in the commencement of first session after each general election . Proposal for a new building ( edit ) A new Parliament building may replace the existing complex . The new building is being considered on account of the stability concerns regarding the current complex . A committee to suggest alternatives to the current building has been set up by the Former Speaker , Meira Kumar . The present building , an 85 - year - old structure suffers from inadequacy of space to house members and their staff and is thought to suffer from structural issues . The building also needs to be protected because of its heritage tag . Composition ( edit ) The Indian Parliament consists of two houses called the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha with the President of India acting as their head . President of India ( edit ) Main article : President of India The President of India , the Head of state is a component of Parliament . Under Article 60 and Article 111 , President 's responsibility is to scrutinise that bills / laws passed by the parliament are in accordance with constitutional mandate and stipulated procedure is followed before according his / her approval to the bills . The President of India is elected by the members of Parliament of India and the state legislatures and serves for a term of five years . Lok Sabha ( edit ) Main article : Lok Sabha Lok Sabha ( House of the People ) or the lower house has 545 members . 543 members are directly elected by citizens of India on the basis of universal adult franchise representing Parliamentary constituencies across the country and 2 members are appointed by the President of India from Anglo - Indian Community . Every citizen of India who is over 18 years of age , irrespective of gender , caste , religion or race , who is otherwise not disqualified , is eligible to vote for the Lok Sabha. The Constitution provides that the maximum strength of the House be 552 members . It has a term of five years . To be eligible for membership in the Lok Sabha , a person must be a citizen of India and must be 25 years of age or older , mentally sound , should not be bankrupt and should not be criminally convicted . The total elective membership is distributed among the States in such a way that the ratio between the number of seats allotted to each State and the population of the State is , so far as practicable , the same for all States . Rajya Sabha ( edit ) Main article : Rajya Sabha Rajya Sabha ( Council of States ) or the upper house is a permanent body not subject to dissolution . One third of the members retire every second year , and are replaced by newly elected members . Each member is elected for a term of six years . Its members are indirectly elected by members of legislative bodies of the states . The Rajya Sabha can have a maximum of 250 members . It currently has a sanctioned strength of 245 members , of which 233 are elected from States and Union Territories and 12 are nominated by the President . The number of members from a state depends on its population . The minimum age for a person to become a member of Rajya Sabha is 30 years . Session of Parliament ( edit ) The period during which the House meets to conduct its business is called a session . The Constitution empowers the president to summon each House at such intervals that there should not be more than a six - month gap between the two sessions . Hence the Parliament must meet at least twice a year . In India , the parliament conducts three sessions each year : Budget session : February to May Monsoon session : July to September Winter session : November to December Lawmaking procedures ( edit ) Main article : Lawmaking procedure in India Legislative proposals are brought before either house of the Parliament in the form of a bill . A bill is the draft of a legislative proposal , which , when passed by both houses of Parliament and assented to by the President , becomes an Act of Parliament . Money bills must originate in the Lok Sabha . The council of states can only make recommendations over the bills to the House , within a period of fourteen days . Parliamentary committees ( edit ) Parliamentary committees are formed to deliberate specific matters at length . The public is directly or indirectly associated and studies are conducted to help committees arrive at the conclusions . Parliamentary committees are of two kinds : Ad hoc committees and the Standing committees . Standing committees are permanent committees constituted from time to time in pursuance of the provisions of an act of Parliament or rules of procedure and conduct of business in Parliament . The work of these committees is of a continuing nature . Ad hoc committees are appointed for a specific purpose and they cease to exist when they finish the task assigned to them and submits a report . Incidents ( edit ) Main article : 2001 Indian Parliament attack On 13 December 2001 , Indian Parliament was attacked by a terrorist organisation . The perpetrators were Lashkar - e-Taiba ( Let ) and Jaish - e-Mohammed ( JeM ) terrorists .

            "Document Text: Joint session of Indian Parliament - wikipedia Joint session of Indian Parliament Jump to : navigation , search The Parliament of India is bicameral . Concurrence of both houses are required to pass any bill . However , the authors of the Constitution of India visualised situations of deadlock between the upper house i.e. Rajya Sabha and the lower house i.e. Lok Sabha . Therefore , the Constitution of India provides for Joint sittings of both the Houses to break this deadlock . The joint sitting of the Parliament is called by the President and is presided over by the Speaker or , in his absence , by the Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha or in his absence , the Deputy - Chairman of the Rajya Sabha . If any of the above officers are not present then any other member of the Parliament can preside by consensus of both the House . Contents ( hide ) 1 Provisions of Constitution 2 Exception to joint sittings 3 Bills referred to joint session 4 References Provisions of Constitution ( edit ) As per Article 108 of Constitution , a Joint session of Parliament can be summoned in the following situations . If after a Bill has been passed by one House and transmitted to the other House -- ( a ) the Bill is rejected by the other House ; or ( b ) the Houses have finally disagreed as to the amendments to be made in the Bill ; or ( c ) more than six months elapse from the date of the reception of the Bill by the other House without the Bill being passed by it , the President may , unless the Bill has elapsed by reason of a dissolution of the House of the People , notify to the Houses by message if they are sitting or by public notification if they are not sitting , his intention to summon them to meet in a joint sitting for the purpose of deliberating and voting on the Bill However , in calculating period of six months , those days are not considered when house is prorogued or adjourned for more than 4 consecutive days . If the above conditions are satisfied , the President of India may summon joint sitting of both the houses of parliament . Exception to joint sittings ( edit ) Not all bills can be refereed to a joint sitting of Parliament . There are two exception . 1 . Money Bill Under the Constitution of India , money bills require approval of the Lok Sabha only . Rajya Sabha can make recommendations to Lok Sabha , which it is not required to accept . Even if Rajya Sabha does n't pass a money bill within 14 days , it is deemed to have been passed by both the Houses of Parliament after expiry of the above period . Therefore , a requirement to summon a joint session can never arise in the case of money bill . 2 . Constitution Amendment Bill Article 368 of Indian constitution require that constitution of India can be amended by both houses of parliament by 2 / 3 majority . In case of disagreement between both houses , there is no provision to summon joint session of parliament . Bills referred to joint session ( edit ) Joint session of Indian parliament has been called for only three bills i.e. dowry prohibition act , 1961 , banking service commission act , 1977 and POTA , 2002 . BILLS PASSED IN JOINT SESSION : 1 . Dowry Prohibition Bill , 1961 2 . Banking Service Commission ( Repeal ) Bill , 1978 3 .

Members of the Lok Sabha are elected by adult universal suffrage and a first - past - the - post system to represent their respective constituencies , and they hold their seats for five years or until the body is dissolved by the President on the advice of the council of ministers . The house meets in the Lok Sabha Chambers of the Sansad Bhavan in New Delhi . The maximum strength of the House allotted by the Constitution of India is 552 . Currently the house has 545 seats which is made up by election of up to 543 elected members and at a maximum , 2 nominated members of the Anglo - Indian Community by the President of India . A total of 131 seats ( 24.03 % ) are reserved for representatives of Scheduled Castes ( 84 ) and Scheduled Tribes ( 47 ) . The quorum for the House is 10 % of the total membership . The Lok Sabha , unless sooner dissolved , continues to operate for five years from the date appointed for its first meeting . However , while a proclamation of emergency is in operation , this period may be extended by Parliament by law . An exercise to redraw Lok Sabha constituencies ' boundaries is carried out by the Boundary Delimitation Commission of India every decade based on the Indian census , last of which was conducted in 2001 . This exercise earlier also included redistribution of seats among states based on demographic changes but that provision of the mandate of the commission was suspended in 1976 following a constitutional amendment to incentivise the family planning programme which was being implemented . The 16th Lok Sabha was elected in May 2014 and is the latest to date . The Lok Sabha has its own television channel , Lok Sabha TV , headquartered within the premises of Parliament .

( March 2014 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) A major portion of the Indian subcontinent was under British rule from 1858 to 1947 . During this period , the office of the Secretary of State for India ( along with the Council of India ) was the authority through whom British Parliament exercised its rule in the Indian sub-continent , and the office of Viceroy of India was created , along with an Executive Council in India , consisting of high officials of the British government . The Indian Councils Act 1861 provided for a Legislative Council consisting of the members of the Executive Council and non-official members . The Indian Councils Act 1892 established legislatures in each of the provinces of British India and increased the powers of the Legislative Council . Although these Acts increased the representation of Indians in the government , their power still remained limited , and the electorate very small . The Indian Councils Act 1909 and the Government of India Act 1919 further expanded the participation of Indians in the administration . The Government of India Act 1935 introduced provincial autonomy and proposed a federal structure in India . The Indian Independence Act 1947 , passed by the British parliament on 18 July 1947 , divided British India ( which did not include the Princely States ) into two new independent countries , India and Pakistan , which were to be dominions under the Crown until they had each enacted a new constitution . The Constituent Assembly was divided into two for the separate nations , with each new Assembly having sovereign powers transferred to it for the respective dominion . The Constitution of India was adopted on 26 November 1949 and came into effect on 26 January 1950 , proclaiming India to be a sovereign , democratic republic . This contained the founding principles of the law of the land which would govern India in its new form , which now included all the princely states which had not acceded to Pakistan . According to Article 79 ( Part V - The Union . ) of the Constitution of India , the Parliament of India consists of the President of India and the two Houses of Parliament known as the Council of States ( Rajya Sabha ) and the House of the People ( Lok Sabha ) . The Lok Sabha ( House of the Leaders ) was duly constituted for the first time on 17 April 1952 after the first General Elections held from 25 October 1951 to 21 February 1952 . Session of Lok Sabha commenced on Date Session No . Date First 13 May 1952 Second April 1957 Third April 1962 Fourth March 1967 Fifth March 1971 Sixth March 1977 Seventh January 1980 Eighth December 1984 Ninth December 1989 Tenth June 1991 Eleventh May 1996 Twelfth March 1998 Thirteenth October 1999 Fourteenth May 2004 Fifteenth May 2009 Sixteenth ( Current ) May 2014 Qualifications ( edit ) See also : Election Commission of India Article 84 ( Part V. -- The Union ) of Indian Constitution sets qualifications for being a member of Lok Sabha , which are as follows : He / She should be a citizen of India , and must subscribe before the Election Commission of India an oath or affirmation according to the form set out for the purpose in the Third Schedule of Indian Constitution . He / She should not be less than 25 years of age . He / She possesses such other qualifications as may be prescribed in that behalf by or under any law made by Parliament . He / She should not be proclaimed criminal i.e. they should not be a convict , a confirmed debtor or otherwise disqualified by law ; and He / She should have his / her name in the electoral rolls in any part of the country . However , a member can be disqualified of being a member of Parliament : If he / she holds office of profit ; If he / she is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a competent court If he / she is an undischarged insolvent ; If he / she is not a citizen of India , or has voluntarily acquired the citizenship of a foreign State , or is under any acknowledgment of allegiance or adherence to a foreign State ; If he / she is violating party discipline ( as per Tenth schedule of the constitution ) ; disqualified under Representation of People Act . A seat in the Lok Sabha will become vacant in the following circumstances ( during normal functioning of the House ) : When the holder of the seat , by writing to the speaker , resigns . When the holder of the seat is absent from 60 consecutive days of proceedings of the House , without prior permission of the Speaker . When the holder of the seat is subject to any disqualifications mentioned in the Constitution or any law enacted by Parliament . A seat may also be vacated when the holder stands disqualified under the ' Anti-Defection Law ' . Furthermore , as per article 101 ( Part V. -- The Union ) of the Indian Constitution , a person can not be : A member of both Houses of Parliament and provision shall be made by Parliament by law for the vacation by a person who is chosen a member of both Houses of his seat in one House or the other . A member both of Parliament and of a House of the Legislature of a State . System of elections in Lok Sabha ( edit ) Members of the Lok Sabha are directly elected by the people of India , on the basis of Universal Suffrage . For the purpose of holding direct elections to Lok Sabha ; each state is divided into territorial constituencies . In this respect , the constitution of India makes the following two provisions : Each state is allotted a number of seats in the Lok Sabha in such a manner that the ratio between that number and its population is same for all the states of India . This provision does not apply for states having a population of less than 6 million ( 60 lakhs ) . Each state is divided into territorial constituencies in such a manner that the ratio between the population of each constituency and the number of seats allotted to it remain the same throughout the state . Note : The expression population while distributing seats among states refers to the population ascertained at the census of 1971 . The expression population while distributing constituencies within a state refers to the population ascertained at the census of 2001 . Powers ( edit ) The Lok Sabha has certain powers that make it more powerful than the Rajya Sabha . Motions of no confidence against the government can be introduced and passed in the Lok Sabha . If passed by a majority vote , the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers resign collectively . The Rajya Sabha has no power over such a motion , and hence has no real power over the executive . This is because the Constitution of India has only made the Union Council of ministers responsible to the Lok Sabha , not to the Rajya Sabha . Money bills can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha , and upon being passed , are sent to the Rajya Sabha , where it can be deliberated on for up to 14 days . If not rejected by the Rajya Sabha , or 14 days lapse from the introduction of the bill in the Rajya Sabha without any action by the House , or recommendations made by the Rajya Sabha are not accepted by the Lok Sabha , the bill is considered passed . The budget is presented in the Lok Sabha by the Finance Minister in the name of the President of India . In matters pertaining to non-financial ( ordinary ) bills , after the bill has been passed by the House where it was originally tabled ( Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha ) , it is sent to the other house , where it may be kept for a maximum period of 6 months . If the other House rejects the bill or a period of 6 months elapses without any action by that House , or the House that originally tabled the bill does not accept the recommendations made by the members of the other house , it results in a deadlock . This is resolved by a joint session of both Houses , presided over by the speaker of the Lok Sabha and decided by a simple majority . Though the Constitution has placed both houses on the same footing in this regard , in reality it is the Lok Sabha 's opinions that mostly prevails -- due to its bigger numerical strength . Equal Powers with the Rajya Sabha in initiating and passing any Bill for Constitutional Amendment ( by a majority of the total membership of the House and at least two - thirds majority of the members present and voting ) . Equal Powers with the Rajya Sabha in initiating and passing a motion for the impeachment of the President ( by two - thirds of the membership of the House ) . Equal Powers with the Rajya Sabha in impeachment process ( initiating and passing a motion for the removal ) of the judges of the Supreme Court and the state High Courts ( by a majority of the membership of the House and at least two - thirds majority of the members present and voting ) , who then can be removed by the President of India . Equal Powers with the Rajya Sabha in initiating and passing a resolution declaring war or national emergency ( by two - thirds majority ) or constitutional emergency ( by simple majority ) in a state . If the Lok Sabha is dissolved before or after the declaration of a National Emergency , the Rajya Sabha becomes the sole Parliament . It can not be dissolved . This is a limitation on the Lok Sabha . But there is a possibility that president can exceed the term to not more than 1 year under the proclamation of emergency and the same would be lowered down to six - month if the said proclamation ceases to operate . In conclusion , it is clear that the Lok Sabha is more powerful than the Rajya Sabha in almost all matters . Even in those matters in which the Constitution has placed both Houses on an equal footing , the Lok Sabha has more influence due to its greater numerical strength . This is typical of any Parliamentary democracy , with the lower House always being more powerful than the upper . Procedure ( edit ) Procedure in the House ( edit ) The Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha and Directions issued by the Speaker from time to time there under regulate the procedure in Lok Sabha . The items of business , notice of which is received from the Ministers / Private Members and admitted by the Speaker , are included in the daily List of Business which is printed and circulated to members in advance . For various items of business to be taken up in the House the time is allotted by the House on the recommendations of the Business Advisory Committee . The Speaker presides over the sessions of the House and regulates procedure . Sessions and time of sittings ( edit ) Three sessions of Lok Sabha take place in a year : Budget session : February to May . Monsoon session : July to September . Winter session : November to mid December . When in session , Lok Sabha holds its sittings usually from 11 A.M. to 1 P.M. and from 2 P.M. to 6 P.M. On some days the sittings are continuously held without observing lunch break and are also extended beyond 6 P.M. depending upon the business before the House . Lok Sabha does not ordinarily sit on Saturdays and Sundays and other closed holidays . Question Hour ( edit ) The first hour of every sitting is called Question Hour . Asking questions in Parliament is the free and unfettered right of members , and during Question Hour they may ask questions of ministers on different aspects of administration and government policy in the national and international spheres . Every minister whose turn it is to answer to questions has to stand up and answer for his department 's acts of omission or commission . Questions are of three types -- Starred , Unstarred and Short Notice . A Starred Question is one to which a member desires an oral answer in the House and which is distinguished by an asterisk mark . An unstarred Question is one which is not called for oral answer in the house and on which no supplementary questions can consequently be asked . An answer to such a question is given in writing . Minimum period of notice for starred / unstarred question is 10 clear days . If the questions given notice of are admitted by the Speaker , they are listed and printed for answer on the dates allotted to the Ministries to which the subject matter of the question pertains . The normal period of notice does not apply to short notice questions which relate to matters of urgent public importance . However , a Short Notice Question may be answered only on short notice if so permitted by the Speaker and the Minister concerned is prepared to answer it at shorter notice . A short notice question is taken up for answer immediately after the Question Hour , popularly known as Zero Hour . Zero Hour ( edit ) The time immediately following the Question Hour has come to be known as `` Zero Hour '' . It starts at around 12 noon ( hence the name ) and members can , with prior notice to the Speaker , raise issues of importance during this time . Typically , discussions on important Bills , the Budget , and other issues of national importance take place from 2 pm onwards . Business after question Hour ( edit ) After the Question Hour , the House takes up miscellaneous items of work before proceeding to the main business of the day . These may consist of one or more of the following : Adjournment Motions , Questions involving breaches of Privileges , Papers to be laid on the Table , Communication of any messages from Rajya Sabha , Intimations regarding President 's assent to Bills , Calling Attention Notices , Matters under Rule 377 , Presentation of Reports of Parliamentary Committee , Presentation of Petitions , miscellaneous statements by Ministers , Motions regarding elections to Committees , Bills to be withdrawn or introduced . Main business ( edit ) The main business of the day may be consideration of a Bill or financial business or consideration of a resolution or a motion . Legislative business ( edit ) Legislative proposals in the form of a Bill can be brought forward either by a Minister or by a private member . In the former case it is known as Government Bill and in the latter case it is known as a Private Members ' Bill . Every Bill passes through three stages -- called three readings -- before it is passed . To become law it must be passed by both the Houses of Parliament , Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha , and then assented to by the president . Financial business ( edit ) The presentation , discussion of , and voting on the annual General and Railways budgets -- followed by the passing of the Appropriations Bill and the Finance Bill -- is a long , drawn - out process that takes up a major part of the time of the House during its Budget Session every year . Motions and resolutions ( edit ) Among other kinds of business that come up before the House are resolutions and motions . Resolutions and motions may be brought forward by Government or by private members . Government may move a resolution or a motion for obtaining the sanction to a scheme or opinion of the House on an important matter of policy or on a grave situation . Similarly , a private member may move a resolution or motion in order to draw the attention of the House and of the Government to a particular problem . The last two and half hours of sitting on every Friday are generally allotted for transaction of private members ' business . While private members ' bills are taken up on one Friday , private members ' resolutions are taken up on the succeeding Friday , and so on . Parliamentary Committees ( edit ) Most of the business of drafting a bill or amendments are initially discussed and debated in the parliamentary committees . Since the time for legislation is limited , work of all departments of the government and any special focus tasks is delegated to the committees , wherein the committees shall prepare the initial draft of the bill / amendment for the consideration by both the houses . They consist of members from both the houses There are primarily two kinds of parliamentary committees based on their nature -- Parliament Standing Committees ( PSC ) -- Permanent in nature , reconstituted time to time with every new election . Department based Others Ad hoc Committees -- Created for specific purpose and ceases to exist when that purpose is achieved . Half - an - Hour discussion ( edit ) A Half - an - Hour Discussion can be raised on a matter of sufficient public importance which has been the subject of a recent question in Lok Sabha irrespective of the fact whether the question was answered orally or the answer was laid on the Table of the House and the answer which needs elucidation on a matter of fact . Normally not more than half an hour is allowed for such a discussion . Usually , half - an - hour discussion is listed on Mondays , Wednesdays and Fridays only . In one session , a member is allowed to raise not more than two half - an - hour discussions . During the discussion , the member , who has given notice , makes a short statement and not more than four members , who have intimated earlier and have secured one of the four places in the ballot , are permitted to ask a question each for further elucidating any matter of fact . Thereafter , the Minister concerned replies . There is no formal motion before the House nor voting . Discussion on matters of urgent public importance ( edit ) Members may raise discussions on matters of urgent public importance with the permission of the Speaker . Such discussions may take place on two days in a week . No formal motion is moved in the House nor is there any voting on such a discussion . Debate in the House ( edit ) After the member who initiates discussion on an item of business has spoken , other members can speak on that item of business in such order as the Speaker may call upon them . Only one member can speak at a time and all speeches are directed to the Chair . A matter requiring the decision of the House is decided by means of a question put by the Speaker on a motion made by a member . Division ( edit ) A division is one of the forms in which the decision of the House is ascertained . Normally , when a motion is put to the House members for and against it indicate their opinion by saying `` Aye '' or `` No '' from their seats . The Chair goes by the voices and declares that the motion is either accepted or rejected by the House . If a member challenges the decision , the Chair orders that the lobbies be cleared . Then the division bell is rung and an entire network of bells installed in the various parts and rooms in Parliament House and Parliament House Annexe rings continuously for three and a half minutes . Members and Ministers rush to the Chamber from all sides . After the bell stops , all the doors to the Chamber are closed and nobody can enter or leave the Chamber till the division is over . Then the Chair puts the question for second time and declares whether in its opinion the `` Ayes '' or the `` Noes '' , have it . If the opinion so declared is again challenged , the Chair asks the votes to be recorded by operating the Automatic Vote Recording Equipment . Automatic vote Recording system ( edit ) With the announcement of the Speaker for recording the votes , the Secretary - General of the Lok Sabha presses the button of a key board . Then a gong sounds , serving as a signal to members for casting their votes . To vote , each member present in the Chamber has to flip a switch and then operate one of the three push buttons fixed in their seat . The push switch must be kept pressed simultaneously until the gong sounds for the second time after 10 seconds . There are two indicator boards installed in the wall on either side of the Speaker 's chair in the Chamber . Each vote cast by a member is flashed here . Immediately after the votes are cast , they are totalled mechanically and the details of the results are flashed on the Result Indicator Boards installed in the railings of the Speaker 's and Diplomatic Galleries . Divisions are normally held with the aid of the Automatic Vote Recording Equipment . Where so directed by the Speaker in terms of relevant provision in the Rules of Procedure etc. in Lok Sabha , divisions may be held either by distribution of ' Aye ' / ' No ' and ' Abstention ' slips to members in the House or by the members recording their votes by going into the lobbies . There is an Indicator Board in the machine room showing the name of each member . The result of Division and vote cast by each member with the aid of Automatic Vote Recording Equipment appear also on this Board and immediately a photograph of the Indicator Board is taken . Later the Photograph is enlarged and the names of members who voted ' Ayes ' and for ' Noes ' are determined with the help of the photograph and incorporated in Lok Sabha Debates . Publication of Debates ( edit ) Three versions of Lok Sabha Debates are prepared : the Hindi version , the English version and the Original version . Only the Hindi and English versions are printed . The Original version , in cyclostyled form , is kept in the Parliament Library for record and reference . The Hindi version contains proceedings ( all Questions asked and Answers given thereto and speeches made ) in Hindi , and verbatim Hindi translation of proceedings in English or in regional languages . The English version contains proceedings in English and the English translation of the proceedings which take place in Hindi or in any regional language . The Original version , however , contains proceedings in Hindi or in English as they actually took place in the House and also the English / Hindi translation of speeches made in regional languages . If conflicting legislation is enacted by the two Houses , a joint sitting is held to resolve the differences . In such a session , the members of the Lok Sabha would generally prevail , since the Lok Sabha includes more than twice as many members as the Rajya Sabha . Officers of Lok Sabha ( edit ) Speaker and Deputy Speaker As per Article 93 of Indian Constitution , the Lok Sabha has a Speaker and a Deputy Speaker . In the Lok Sabha , both presiding officers -- the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker - are elected from among its members by a simple majority of members present and voting in the House . No specific qualifications are prescribed for being elected Speaker ; the Constitution only requires that Speaker should be a member of the House . But an understanding of the Constitution and the laws of the country and the rules of procedure and conventions of Parliament is considered a major asset for the holder of the office of the Speaker . Vacation and resignation of , and removal from , the offices of Speaker and Deputy Speaker are mentioned under Article 94 of the Constitution of India . As per Article 94 of Indian Constitution , a Speaker or a Deputy Speaker should vacate his / her office , a ) if he / she ceases to be a member of the House of the People , b ) he / she resigns , or c ) is removed from office by a resolution of the House passed by a majority . The Speaker of Lok Sabha is both a member of the House and its Presiding Officer . The Speaker conducts the business in the House . He / she decides whether a bill is a money bill or not . He / she maintains discipline and decorum in the house and can punish a member for their unruly behaviour by suspending them . He / she permits the moving of various kinds of motions and resolutions like the motion of no confidence , motion of adjournment , motion of censure and calling attention notice as per the rules . The Speaker decides on the agenda to be taken up for discussion during the meeting . It is the Speaker of the Lok Sabha who presides over joint sittings called in the event of disagreement between the two Houses on a legislative measure . Following the 52nd Constitution amendment , the Speaker is vested with the power relating to the disqualification of a member of the Lok Sabha on grounds of defection . The Speaker makes obituary references in the House , formal references to important national and international events and the valedictory address at the conclusion of every Session of the Lok Sabha and also when the term of the House expires . Though a member of the House , the Speaker does not vote in the House except on those rare occasions when there is a tie at the end of a decision . Till date , the Speaker of the Lok Sabha has not been called upon to exercise this unique casting vote . While the office of Speaker is vacant due to absence / resignation / removal , the duties of the office are performed by the Deputy Speaker or , if the office of Deputy Speaker is also vacant , by such member of the House of the People as the President may appoint for the purpose . The Lok Sabha has also a separate non-elected Secretariat staff . Shri G.V. Mavalankar was the first Speaker of Lok Sabha ( 15 May 1952 -- 27 February 1956 ) and Shri M. Ananthasayanam Ayyangar was the first Deputy Speaker ( 30 May 1952 -- 7 March 1956 ) . In the 16th Lok Sabha , Sumitra Mahajan was elected as the speaker on 3 June 2014 , and is its second woman speaker and Shri M. Thambidurai as the deputy speaker .

Members of the Lok Sabha are elected by adult universal suffrage and a first - past - the - post system to represent their respective constituencies , and they hold their seats for five years or until the body is dissolved by the President on the advice of the council of ministers . The house meets in the Lok Sabha Chambers of the Sansad Bhavan in New Delhi . The maximum strength of the House allotted by the Constitution of India is 552 . Currently the house has 545 seats which is made up by election of up to 543 elected members and at a maximum , 2 nominated members of the Anglo - Indian Community by the President of India . A total of 131 seats ( 24.03 % ) are reserved for representatives of Scheduled Castes ( 84 ) and Scheduled Tribes ( 47 ) . The quorum for the House is 10 % of the total membership . The Lok Sabha , unless sooner dissolved , continues to operate for five years from the date appointed for its first meeting . However , while a proclamation of emergency is in operation , this period may be extended by Parliament by law . An exercise to redraw Lok Sabha constituencies ' boundaries is carried out by the Boundary Delimitation Commission of India every decade based on the Indian census , last of which was conducted in 2001 . This exercise earlier also included redistribution of seats among states based on demographic changes but that provision of the mandate of the commission was suspended in 1976 following a constitutional amendment to incentivise the family planning programme which was being implemented . The 16th Lok Sabha was elected in May 2014 and is the latest to date . The Lok Sabha has its own television channel , Lok Sabha TV , headquartered within the premises of Parliament .

( March 2014 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) A major portion of the Indian subcontinent was under British rule from 1858 to 1947 . During this period , the office of the Secretary of State for India ( along with the Council of India ) was the authority through whom British Parliament exercised its rule in the Indian sub-continent , and the office of Viceroy of India was created , along with an Executive Council in India , consisting of high officials of the British government . The Indian Councils Act 1861 provided for a Legislative Council consisting of the members of the Executive Council and non-official members . The Indian Councils Act 1892 established legislatures in each of the provinces of British India and increased the powers of the Legislative Council . Although these Acts increased the representation of Indians in the government , their power still remained limited , and the electorate very small . The Indian Councils Act 1909 and the Government of India Act 1919 further expanded the participation of Indians in the administration . The Indian Independence Act 1947 , passed by the British parliament on 18 July 1947 , divided British India ( which did not include the Princely States ) into two new independent countries , India and Pakistan , which were to be dominions under the Crown until they had each enacted a new constitution . The Constituent Assembly was divided into two for the separate nations , with each new Assembly having sovereign powers transferred to it for the respective dominion . The Constitution of India was adopted on 26 November 1949 and came into effect on 26 January 1950 , proclaiming India to be a sovereign , democratic republic . This contained the founding principles of the law of the land which would govern India in its new form , which now included all the princely states which had not acceded to Pakistan . According to Article 79 ( Part V - The Union . ) of the Constitution of India , the Parliament of India consists of the President of India and the two Houses of Parliament known as the Council of States ( Rajya Sabha ) and the House of the People ( Lok Sabha ) . The Lok Sabha ( House of the Leaders ) was duly constituted for the first time on 17 April 1952 after the first General Elections held from 25 October 1951 to 21 February 1952 . Session of Lok Sabha commenced on Date Session No . Date First 13 May 1952 Second April 1957 Third April 1962 Fourth March 1967 Fifth March 1971 Sixth March 1977 Seventh January 1980 Eighth December 1984 Ninth December 1989 Tenth June 1991 Eleventh May 1996 Twelfth March 1998 Thirteenth October 1999 Fourteenth May 2004 Fifteenth May 2009 Sixteenth ( Current ) May 2014 Qualifications ( edit ) See also : Election Commission of India Article 84 ( Part V. -- The Union ) of Indian Constitution sets qualifications for being a member of Lok Sabha , which are as follows : He / She should be a citizen of India , and must subscribe before the Election Commission of India an oath or affirmation according to the form set out for the purpose in the Third Schedule of Indian Constitution . He / She should not be less than 25 years of age . He / She possesses such other qualifications as may be prescribed in that behalf by or under any law made by Parliament . He / She should not be proclaimed criminal i.e. they should not be a convict , a confirmed debtor or otherwise disqualified by law ; and He / She should have his / her name in the electoral rolls in any part of the country . However , a member can be disqualified of being a member of Parliament : If he / she holds office of profit ; If he / she is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a competent court If he / she is an undischarged insolvent ; If he / she is not a citizen of India , or has voluntarily acquired the citizenship of a foreign State , or is under any acknowledgment of allegiance or adherence to a foreign State ; If he / she is violating party discipline ( as per Tenth schedule of the constitution ) ; disqualified under Representation of People Act . A seat in the Lok Sabha will become vacant in the following circumstances ( during normal functioning of the House ) : When the holder of the seat , by writing to the speaker , resigns . When the holder of the seat is absent from 60 consecutive days of proceedings of the House , without prior permission of the Speaker . When the holder of the seat is subject to any disqualifications mentioned in the Constitution or any law enacted by Parliament . A seat may also be vacated when the holder stands disqualified under the ' Anti-Defection Law ' . Furthermore , as per article 101 ( Part V. -- The Union ) of the Indian Constitution , a person can not be : A member of both Houses of Parliament and provision shall be made by Parliament by law for the vacation by a person who is chosen a member of both Houses of his seat in one House or the other . A member both of Parliament and of a House of the Legislature of a State . System of elections in Lok Sabha ( edit ) Members of the Lok Sabha are directly elected by the people of India , on the basis of Universal Suffrage . For the purpose of holding direct elections to Lok Sabha ; each state is divided into territorial constituencies . In this respect , the constitution of India makes the following two provisions : Each state is allotted a number of seats in the Lok Sabha in such a manner that the ratio between that number and its population is same for all the states of India . This provision does not apply for states having a population of less than 6 million ( 60 lakhs ) . Each state is divided into territorial constituencies in such a manner that the ratio between the population of each constituency and the number of seats allotted to it remain the same throughout the state . Note : The expression population here refers to the population ascertained at the preceding census ( 2001 Census ) of which relevant figure have been published . Powers ( edit ) The Lok Sabha has certain powers that make it more powerful than the Rajya Sabha . Motions of no confidence against the government can be introduced and passed in the Lok Sabha . If passed by a majority vote , the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers resign collectively . The Rajya Sabha has no power over such a motion , and hence has no real power over the executive . This is because the Constitution of India has only made the Union Council of ministers responsible to the Lok Sabha , not to the Rajya Sabha . Money bills can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha , and upon being passed , are sent to the Rajya Sabha , where it can be deliberated on for up to 14 days . If not rejected by the Rajya Sabha , or 14 days lapse from the introduction of the bill in the Rajya Sabha without any action by the House , or recommendations made by the Rajya Sabha are not accepted by the Lok Sabha , the bill is considered passed . The budget is presented in the Lok Sabha by the Finance Minister in the name of the President of India . In matters pertaining to non-financial ( ordinary ) bills , after the bill has been passed by the House where it was originally tabled ( Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha ) , it is sent to the other house , where it may be kept for a maximum period of 6 months . If the other House rejects the bill or a period of 6 months elapses without any action by that House , or the House that originally tabled the bill does not accept the recommendations made by the members of the other house , it results in a deadlock . This is resolved by a joint session of both Houses , presided over by the speaker of the Lok Sabha and decided by a simple majority . Though the Constitution has placed both houses on the same footing in this regard , in reality it is the Lok Sabha 's opinions that mostly prevails -- due to its bigger numerical strength . Equal Powers with the Rajya Sabha in initiating and passing any Bill for Constitutional Amendment ( by a majority of the total membership of the House and at least two - thirds majority of the members present and voting ) . Equal Powers with the Rajya Sabha in initiating and passing a motion for the impeachment of the President ( by two - thirds of the membership of the House ) . Equal Powers with the Rajya Sabha in impeachment process ( initiating and passing a motion for the removal ) of the judges of the Supreme Court and the state High Courts ( by a majority of the membership of the House and at least two - thirds majority of the members present and voting ) , who then can be removed by the President of India . Equal Powers with the Rajya Sabha in initiating and passing a resolution declaring war or national emergency ( by two - thirds majority ) or constitutional emergency ( by simple majority ) in a state . If the Lok Sabha is dissolved before or after the declaration of a National Emergency , the Rajya Sabha becomes the sole Parliament . It can not be dissolved . This is a limitation on the Lok Sabha . But there is a possibility that president can exceed the term to not more than 1 year under the proclamation of emergency and the same would be lowered down to six - month if the said proclamation ceases to operate . In conclusion , it is clear that the Lok Sabha is more powerful than the Rajya Sabha in almost all matters . Even in those matters in which the Constitution has placed both Houses on an equal footing , the Lok Sabha has more influence due to its greater numerical strength . This is typical of any Parliamentary democracy , with the lower House always being more powerful than the upper . Procedure ( edit ) Procedure in the House ( edit ) The Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha and Directions issued by the Speaker from time to time there under regulate the procedure in Lok Sabha . The items of business , notice of which is received from the Ministers / Private Members and admitted by the Speaker , are included in the daily List of Business which is printed and circulated to members in advance . For various items of business to be taken up in the House the time is allotted by the House on the recommendations of the Business Advisory Committee . The Speaker presides over the sessions of the House and regulates procedure . Sessions and time of sittings ( edit ) Three sessions of Lok Sabha take place in a year : Budget session : February to May . Monsoon session : July to September . Winter session : November to mid December . When in session , Lok Sabha holds its sittings usually from 11 A.M. to 1 P.M. and from 2 P.M. to 6 P.M. On some days the sittings are continuously held without observing lunch break and are also extended beyond 6 P.M. depending upon the business before the House . Lok Sabha does not ordinarily sit on Saturdays and Sundays and other closed holidays . Question Hour / Zero Hour ( edit ) The first hour of every sitting is called Question Hour . Asking questions in Parliament is the free and unfettered right of members , and during Question Hour they may ask questions of ministers on different aspects of administration and government policy in the national and international spheres . Every minister whose turn it is to answer to questions has to stand up and answer for his department 's acts of omission or commission . Questions are of three types -- Starred , Unstarred and Short Notice . A Starred Question is one to which a member desires an oral answer in the House and which is distinguished by an asterisk mark . An unstarred Question is one which is not called for oral answer in the house and on which no supplementary questions can consequently be asked . An answer to such a question is given in writing . Minimum period of notice for starred / unstarred question is 10 clear days . If the questions given notice of are admitted by the Speaker , they are listed and printed for answer on the dates allotted to the Ministries to which the subject matter of the question pertains . The normal period of notice does not apply to short notice questions which relate to matters of urgent public importance . However , a Short Notice Question may be answered only on short notice if so permitted by the Speaker and the Minister concerned is prepared to answer it at shorter notice . A short notice question is taken up for answer immediately after the Question Hour , popularly known as Zero Hour . Zero Hour : The time immediately following the Question Hour has come to be known as `` Zero Hour '' . It starts at around 12 noon ( hence the name ) and members can , with prior notice to the Speaker , raise issues of importance during this time . Typically , discussions on important Bills , the Budget , and other issues of national importance take place from 2 pm onwards . Business after question Hour ( edit ) After the Question Hour , the House takes up miscellaneous items of work before proceeding to the main business of the day . These may consist of one or more of the following : Adjournment Motions , Questions involving breaches of Privileges , Papers to be laid on the Table , Communication of any messages from Rajya Sabha , Intimations regarding President 's assent to Bills , Calling Attention Notices , Matters under Rule 377 , Presentation of Reports of Parliamentary Committee , Presentation of Petitions , miscellaneous statements by Ministers , Motions regarding elections to Committees , Bills to be withdrawn or introduced . Main business ( edit ) The main business of the day may be consideration of a Bill or financial business or consideration of a resolution or a motion . Legislative business ( edit ) Legislative proposals in the form of a Bill can be brought forward either by a Minister or by a private member . In the former case it is known as Government Bill and in the latter case it is known as a Private Members ' Bill . Every Bill passes through three stages -- called three readings -- before it is passed . To become law it must be passed by both the Houses of Parliament , Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha , and then assented to by the president . Financial business ( edit ) The presentation , discussion of , and voting on the annual General and Railways budgets -- followed by the passing of the Appropriations Bill and the Finance Bill -- is a long , drawn - out process that takes up a major part of the time of the House during its Budget Session every year . Motions and resolutions ( edit ) Among other kinds of business that come up before the House are resolutions and motions . Resolutions and motions may be brought forward by Government or by private members . Government may move a resolution or a motion for obtaining the sanction to a scheme or opinion of the House on an important matter of policy or on a grave situation . Similarly , a private member may move a resolution or motion in order to draw the attention of the House and of the Government to a particular problem . The last two and half hours of sitting on every Friday are generally allotted for transaction of private members ' business . While private members ' bills are taken up on one Friday , private members ' resolutions are taken up on the succeeding Friday , and so on . Parliamentary Committees ( edit ) Most of the business of drafting a bill or amendments are initially discussed and debated in the parliamentary committees . Since the time for legislation is limited , work of all departments of the government and any special focus tasks is delegated to the committees , wherein the committees shall prepare the initial draft of the bill / amendment for the consideration by both the houses . They consist of members from both the houses There are primarily two kinds of parliamentary committees based on their nature -- Parliament Standing Committees ( PSC ) -- Permanent in nature , reconstituted time to time with every new election Department based Others Ad hoc Committees -- Created for specific purpose and ceases to exist when that purpose is achieved . Half - an - Hour discussion ( edit ) A Half - an - Hour Discussion can be raised on a matter of sufficient public importance which has been the subject of a recent question in Lok Sabha irrespective of the fact whether the question was answered orally or the answer was laid on the Table of the House and the answer which needs elucidation on a matter of fact . Normally not more than half an hour is allowed for such a discussion . Usually , half - an - hour discussion is listed on Mondays , Wednesdays and Fridays only . In one session , a member is allowed to raise not more than two half - an - hour discussions . During the discussion , the member , who has given notice , makes a short statement and not more than four members , who have intimated earlier and have secured one of the four places in the ballot , are permitted to ask a question each for further elucidating any matter of fact . Thereafter , the Minister concerned replies . There is no formal motion before the House nor voting . Discussion on matters of urgent public importance ( edit ) Members may raise discussions on matters of urgent public importance with the permission of the Speaker . Such discussions may take place on two days in a week . No formal motion is moved in the House nor is there any voting on such a discussion . Debate in the House ( edit ) After the member who initiates discussion on an item of business has spoken , other members can speak on that item of business in such order as the Speaker may call upon them . Only one member can speak at a time and all speeches are directed to the Chair . A matter requiring the decision of the House is decided by means of a question put by the Speaker on a motion made by a member . Division ( edit ) A division is one of the forms in which the decision of the House is ascertained . Normally , when a motion is put to the House members for and against it indicate their opinion by saying `` Aye '' or `` No '' from their seats . The Chair goes by the voices and declares that the motion is either accepted or rejected by the House . If a member challenges the decision , the Chair orders that the lobbies be cleared . Then the division bell is rung and an entire network of bells installed in the various parts and rooms in Parliament House and Parliament House Annexe rings continuously for three and a half minutes . Members and Ministers rush to the Chamber from all sides . After the bell stops , all the doors to the Chamber are closed and nobody can enter or leave the Chamber till the division is over . Then the Chair puts the question for second time and declares whether in its opinion the `` Ayes '' or the `` Noes '' , have it . If the opinion so declared is again challenged , the Chair asks the votes to be recorded by operating the Automatic Vote Recording Equipment . Automatic vote Recording system ( edit ) With the announcement of the Speaker for recording the votes , the Secretary - General of the Lok Sabha presses the button of a key board . Then a gong sounds , serving as a signal to members for casting their votes . To vote , each member present in the Chamber has to flip a switch and then operate one of the three push buttons fixed in their seat . The push switch must be kept pressed simultaneously until the gong sounds for the second time after 10 seconds . There are two indicator boards installed in the wall on either side of the Speaker 's chair in the Chamber . Each vote cast by a member is flashed here . Immediately after the votes are cast , they are totalled mechanically and the details of the results are flashed on the Result Indicator Boards installed in the railings of the Speaker 's and Diplomatic Galleries . Divisions are normally held with the aid of the Automatic Vote Recording Equipment . Where so directed by the Speaker in terms of relevant provision in the Rules of Procedure etc. in Lok Sabha , divisions may be held either by distribution of ' Aye ' / ' No ' and ' Abstention ' slips to members in the House or by the members recording their votes by going into the lobbies . There is an Indicator Board in the machine room showing the name of each member . The result of Division and vote cast by each member with the aid of Automatic Vote Recording Equipment appear also on this Board and immediately a photograph of the Indicator Board is taken . Later the Photograph is enlarged and the names of members who voted ' Ayes ' and for ' Noes ' are determined with the help of the photograph and incorporated in Lok Sabha Debates . Publication of Debates ( edit ) Three versions of Lok Sabha Debates are prepared : the Hindi version , the English version and the Original version . Only the Hindi and English versions are printed . The Original version , in cyclostyled form , is kept in the Parliament Library for record and reference . The Hindi version contains proceedings ( all Questions asked and Answers given thereto and speeches made ) in Hindi , and verbatim Hindi translation of proceedings in English or in regional languages . The English version contains proceedings in English and the English translation of the proceedings which take place in Hindi or in any regional language . The Original version , however , contains proceedings in Hindi or in English as they actually took place in the House and also the English / Hindi translation of speeches made in regional languages . If conflicting legislation is enacted by the two Houses , a joint sitting is held to resolve the differences . In such a session , the members of the Lok Sabha would generally prevail , since the Lok Sabha includes more than twice as many members as the Rajya Sabha . Officers of Lok Sabha ( edit ) Speaker and Deputy Speaker As per Article 93 of Indian Constitution , the Lok Sabha has a Speaker and a Deputy Speaker . In the Lok Sabha , both presiding officers -- the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker - are elected from among its members by a simple majority of members present and voting in the House . No specific qualifications are prescribed for being elected Speaker ; the Constitution only requires that Speaker should be a member of the House . But an understanding of the Constitution and the laws of the country and the rules of procedure and conventions of Parliament is considered a major asset for the holder of the office of the Speaker . Vacation and resignation of , and removal from , the offices of Speaker and Deputy Speaker are mentioned under Article 94 of the Constitution of India . As per Article 94 of Indian Constitution , a Speaker or a Deputy Speaker should vacate his / her office , a ) if he / she ceases to be a member of the House of the People , b ) he / she resigns , or c ) is removed from office by a resolution of the House passed by a majority . The Speaker of Lok Sabha is both a member of the House and its Presiding Officer . The Speaker conducts the business in the House . He / she decides whether a bill is a money bill or not . He / she maintains discipline and decorum in the house and can punish a member for their unruly behaviour by suspending them . He / she permits the moving of various kinds of motions and resolutions like the motion of no confidence , motion of adjournment , motion of censure and calling attention notice as per the rules . The Speaker decides on the agenda to be taken up for discussion during the meeting . It is the Speaker of the Lok Sabha who presides over joint sittings called in the event of disagreement between the two Houses on a legislative measure . Following the 52nd Constitution amendment , the Speaker is vested with the power relating to the disqualification of a member of the Lok Sabha on grounds of defection . The Speaker makes obituary references in the House , formal references to important national and international events and the valedictory address at the conclusion of every Session of the Lok Sabha and also when the term of the House expires . Though a member of the House , the Speaker does not vote in the House except on those rare occasions when there is a tie at the end of a decision . Till date , the Speaker of the Lok Sabha has not been called upon to exercise this unique casting vote . While the office of Speaker is vacant due to absence / resignation / removal , the duties of the office are performed by the Deputy Speaker or , if the office of Deputy Speaker is also vacant , by such member of the House of the People as the President may appoint for the purpose . The Lok Sabha has also a separate non-elected Secretariat staff . Shri G.V. Mavalankar was the first Speaker of Lok Sabha ( 15 May 1952 -- 27 February 1956 ) and Shri M.

            "FIFA World Cup top goalscorers - wikipedia FIFA World Cup top goalscorers Miroslav Klose celebrating his record - breaking 16th World Cup goal More than 2,500 goals have been scored at the 21 editions of the FIFA World Cup final tournaments , not counting penalties scored during shoot - outs . Since the first goal scored by French player Lucien Laurent at the 1930 FIFA World Cup , more than 1,250 footballers have scored goals at the World Cup , of which just 97 have scored at least five . Number of goalscorers Goals ≥ 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 Total No players 7 6 9 7 8 26 34 > 50 > 90 > 200 > 750 > 1,250 Ronaldo is the player with the second most goals , scoring 15 . The top goalscorer of the inaugural competition was Argentina 's Guillermo Stábile with eight goals . Since then , only 22 players have scored more at all the games played at the World Cup than Stábile did throughout the 1930 tournament . The first was Hungary 's Sándor Kocsis with eleven in 1954 . At the next tournament , France 's Just Fontaine improved on this record with 13 goals in only six games . Gerd Müller scored 10 for West Germany in 1970 and broke the overall record when he scored his 14th goal at the World Cup during West Germany 's win at the 1974 final . His record stood for more than three decades until Ronaldo 's 15 goals between 1998 and 2006 for Brazil . Germany 's Miroslav Klose went on to score a record 16 goals across four consecutive tournaments between 2002 and 2014 . Only two other players have surpassed 10 goals at the World Cup : Pelé with 12 between 1958 and 1970 for Brazil , and Jürgen Klinsmann with 11 between 1990 and 1998 for Germany . Of all the players who have played at the World Cup , only six have scored , on average , at least two goals per game played : Kocsis , Fontaine , Stábile , Russia 's Oleg Salenko , Switzerland 's Josef Hügi , and Poland 's Ernst Wilimowski -- the latter scored four in his single World Cup game in 1938 . The top 97 goalscorers have represented 28 nations , with 14 players scoring for Brazil , and another 14 for Germany or West Germany . In total , 64 footballers came from UEFA ( Europe ) , 29 from CONMEBOL ( South America ) , and only four from elsewhere : Cameroon , Ghana , Australia , and the United States . Fontaine holds the record for the most goals scored at a single tournament , with 13 goals in 1958 . The players that came closest to this record were Kocsis in 1954 , Müller in 1970 and Portugal 's Eusébio in 1966 , with 11 , 10 and 9 , respectively . The lowest scoring tournament 's top scorer was in 1962 , when six players tied at only four goals each . Across the 21 editions of the World Cup , 30 footballers have been credited with the most tournament goals , and no one has achieved this feat twice . Nine of them scored at least seven goals in a tournament , while Brazil 's Jairzinho became in 1970 the only footballer to score at least seven goals without being the top goalscorer of that tournament . These 30 top goalscorers played for 19 nations , the most ( five ) for Brazil . Another five came from other South American countries , with the remaining 20 coming from Europe . Excluding the 2010 edition , all the top tournament scorers won the Golden Boot .

His ratio is 4.00 as he scored four goals in his only World Cup appearance , in 1938 . Jump up ^ FIFA initially credited Leônidas with eight goals in the 1938 tournament , but in November 2006 however , FIFA revised it to seven ( he scored one additional goal in the 1934 tournament ) . Jump up ^ There was a controversy regarding the number of goals scored by Ademir in 1950 because of incomplete data from the final group round game against Spain , that ended in a 6 -- 1 victory for Brazil . The fifth Brazilian goal was credited to Jair , but is now credited to Ademir . Jump up ^ FIFA initially credited Nejedlý with only four goals in 1934 . However , FIFA changed it to five goals in November 2006 , meaning he scored a total of seven goals overall ( he scored two goals in 1938 ) . Jump up ^ Davor Šuker was part of Yugoslavia 's squad in the 1990 FIFA World Cup but did not play any games . After Yugoslavia split , he joined the Croatian national team . Jump up ^ The two initial games of the 1930 FIFA World Cup ( France -- Mexico and United States -- Belgium ) were played at the same time , as seven players scored , with André Maschinot scoring two goals . The order in which these players are listed reflects the actual elapsed time in the games when their goals were scored .

            "Brazil at the FIFA World Cup - wikipedia Brazil at the FIFA World Cup Brazil national team at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia This articles summarizes the results and overall performance of Brazil at the FIFA World Cup . The tournament consists of two parts , the qualification phase and the final phase , officially called the World Cup Finals . The qualification phase , which currently takes place over the three years preceding the Finals , is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals . The current format of the Finals involves 32 teams competing for the title , at venues within the host nation ( or nations ) over a period of about a month . The World Cup Finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world , with an estimated over 1 billion people watching the 2014 tournament final . Brazil is the most successful national team in the history of the World Cup , having won five titles , earning second - place , third - place and fourth - place finishes twice each . Brazil is one of the countries besides Argentina , Spain and Germany to win a FIFA World Cup away from its continent ( Sweden 1958 , Mexico 1970 , USA 1994 and South Korea / Japan 2002 ) . Brazil is the only national team to have played in all FIFA World Cup editions without any absence or need for playoffs . Brazil also has the best overall performance in World Cup history in both proportional and absolute terms with a record of 73 victories in 109 matches played , 124 goal difference , 237 points and only 18 losses . Traditionally , Brazil 's greatest rival is Argentina . The two countries have met each other four times in the history of the FIFA World Cup , with two wins for Brazil ( West Germany 1974 and Spain 1982 ) , one for Argentina ( Italy 1990 ) and a draw ( Argentina 1978 ) . The country that played most against Brazil in the finals is Sweden : 7 times , with five wins for Brazil and two draws . Three other historical rivals are Italy , which lost two World Cup finals against Brazil and eliminated the Brazilians in two tournaments ( France 1938 and Spain 1982 ) , France , which has eliminated Brazil on three occasions ( Mexico 1986 , France 1998 and Germany 2006 ) , and the Netherlands , which has eliminated Brazil at two of their five meetings ( West Germany 1974 and South Africa 2010 ) and won the third place match in Brazil 2014 .

            "FIFA World Cup awards - wikipedia FIFA World Cup awards This is the latest accepted revision , reviewed on 29 October 2018 . This article is about the men 's senior tournament . For the women 's tournament , see FIFA Women 's World Cup awards . At the end of each FIFA World Cup final tournament , several awards are presented to the players and teams which have distinguished themselves in various aspects of the game . Contents 1 Awards 2 Golden Ball 3 Golden Boot 4 Golden Glove 5 Best Young Player Award 6 FIFA Fair Play Trophy 7 Man of the Match 8 Most Entertaining Team 9 All - Star Team 10 Goal of the Tournament 11 References 12 External links Awards ( edit ) There are currently five post-tournament awards , and one given during the tournament : the Golden Ball ( currently commercially termed `` adidas Golden Ball '' ) for best player , first awarded in 1982 ; the Golden Boot ( currently commercially termed `` adidas Golden Boot '' , previously known as the `` adidas Golden Shoe '' from 1982 to 2006 ) for top goal scorer , first awarded in 1982 ; the Golden Glove Award ( currently commercially termed `` adidas Golden Glove '' ; previously known as the `` Lev Yashin Award '' from 1994 to 2006 ) for best goalkeeper , first awarded in 1994 ; the Best Young Player ( currently commercially termed as `` Hyundai Best Young Player '' ) award for best player under 21 years of age at the start of the calendar year , first awarded in 2006 ; the FIFA Fair Play Trophy for the team that advanced to the second round with the best record of fair play , first awarded in 1970 ; the Man of the Match Award ( currently commercially termed as `` Budweiser Man of the Match '' ) for outstanding performance during each game of the tournament , first awarded in 2002 . Two other awards were given between 1994 and 2006 : The Most Entertaining Team award for the team that has entertained the public the most , during the World Cup final tournament , as determined by a poll of the general public ; An All - Star Team comprising the best players of the tournament chosen by the technical study group . Golden Ball ( edit ) The Golden Ball award is presented to the best player at each FIFA World Cup finals , with a shortlist drawn up by the FIFA technical committee and the winner voted for by representatives of the media . Those who finish as runners - up in the vote receive the Silver Ball and Bronze Ball awards as the second and third most outstanding players in the tournament respectively . The current award was introduced in the 1982 FIFA World Cup , sponsored by Adidas and France Football , though fifa.com also lists in their player articles as `` golden ball winners '' Kempes , Cruyff , Pelé , Bobby Charlton , Garrincha and Didi for 1978 , 1974 , 1970 , 1966 , 1962 and 1958 respectively . Barcelona is the only club whose players have won the Golden Ball a record 3 times ( Johan Cruyff in 1974 , Romário in 1994 , Lionel Messi in 2014 ) . Golden Ball World Cup Golden Ball Silver Ball Bronze Ball 1930 Uruguay José Nasazzi Guillermo Stábile José Leandro Andrade 1934 Italy Giuseppe Meazza Matthias Sindelar Oldřich Nejedlý 1938 France Leônidas Silvio Piola György Sárosi 1950 Brazil Zizinho Juan Alberto Schiaffino Ademir 1954 Switzerland Ferenc Puskás Sándor Kocsis Fritz Walter 1958 Sweden Didi Pelé Just Fontaine 1962 Chile Garrincha Josef Masopust Leonel Sánchez 1966 England Bobby Charlton Bobby Moore Eusébio 1970 Mexico Pelé Gérson Gerd Müller 1974 West Germany Johan Cruyff Franz Beckenbauer Kazimierz Deyna 1978 Argentina Mario Kempes Paolo Rossi Dirceu 1982 Spain Paolo Rossi Falcão Karl - Heinz Rummenigge 1986 Mexico Diego Maradona Harald Schumacher Preben Elkjær Larsen 1990 Italy Salvatore Schillaci Lothar Matthäus Diego Maradona 1994 United States Romario Roberto Baggio Hristo Stoichkov 1998 France Ronaldo Davor Šuker Lilian Thuram 2002 Korea / Japan Oliver Kahn Ronaldo Hong Myung - bo 2006 Germany Zinedine Zidane Fabio Cannavaro Andrea Pirlo 2010 South Africa Diego Forlán Wesley Sneijder David Villa 2014 Brazil Lionel Messi Thomas Müller Arjen Robben 2018 Russia Luka Modrić Eden Hazard Antoine Griezmann Golden Boot ( edit ) The Golden Boot or Golden Shoe Award goes to the top goalscorer of the FIFA World Cup . While every World Cup had a ranking of the goalscorers , the first time an award was given was in 1982 , under the name Golden Shoe . It was rechristened Golden Boot in 2010 . FIFA sometimes lists the top goalscorers of previous Cups among the Golden Boot winners . If there is more than one player with the same number of goals , since 1994 the tie - breaker goes to the player without a penalty goal , if none has a penalty then the tie breaker goes to the person with more assists - with the FIFA Technical Study Group deciding whether an assist is to be counted as such . If there is still more than one player , the tie - breaker since 2006 goes to the player who has played the least amount of time , which translates to a higher goal average .

However , FIFA changed it to five goals in November 2006 , making Nejedlý the outright top scorer . Jump up ^ FIFA initially credited Leônidas with eight goals . However , in November 2006 , FIFA confirmed that in the quarter - final tie against Czechoslovakia , he had scored once , not twice as FIFA had originally recorded , meaning he had scored only seven goals in total . Jump up ^ There was controversy regarding the number of goals Brazilian Ademir had scored in 1950 , as a result of incomplete data concerning the Final Round game Brazil vs. Spain ( 6 -- 1 ) . The 5 -- 0 goal had been credited to Jair , but is now credited to Ademir . Jump up ^ Salenko is the only player to win the award playing for a team that were eliminated in the group stages . His six goals are the only international goals he ever scored . Jump up ^ Despite the assist tiebreaker , Salenko and Stoichkov remained tied with 6 goals and one assist each , and both received the Golden Shoe . Jump up ^ Romário and Andersson surpassed the other two players with five goals ( Jürgen Klinsmann and Roberto Baggio ) by having three assists each . Jump up ^ Both runners - up had the same number of assists , and each received the Silver Shoe . Jump up ^ During the tournament , after the group stage match against Costa Rica , Ronaldo logged a protest against the crediting of a goal as an own goal , and FIFA granted him the change . ^ Jump up to : Eight players had scored three goals . Ronaldo , Crespo and Zinedine Zidane stood out for having one assist , and then the two recipients were determined by less playtime ( 308 minutes for Crespo , 411 for Ronaldo , 559 for Zidane ) . ^ Jump up to : Müller , Villa , Sneijder and Diego Forlán tied with five goals . Müller won by virtue of having more assists ( 3 ) than the rest ( each had one ) . Villa won the Silver Boot due to playing fewer minutes than Sneijder , and Sneijder won the Bronze Boot due to having played fewer minutes than Forlán . Jump up ^ Neymar , Lionel Messi and Robin van Persie all had four goals in the tournament . Neymar received the Bronze Boot for playing fewer minutes than his competitors ( 480 ; Messi played 693 minutes , and Van Persie , 548 ) . ^ Jump up to : Griezmann , Lukaku , Denis Cheryshev , Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappé tied with 4 goals . Griezmann won the Silver Boot by virtue of having more assists ( 2 ) than the rest ( Lukaku had one , the rest had zero ) . Lukaku won the Bronze Boot due to having more assists ( one ) than Cheryshev , Ronaldo or Mbappé ( zero ) . Golden Glove ( edit ) The Golden Glove Award is awarded to the best goalkeeper of the tournament . The award was introduced with the name Lev Yashin Award in 1994 , in honor of the late Soviet goalkeeper . The FIFA Technical Study Group recognises the top goalkeeper of the tournament based on the player 's performance throughout the final competition . Although goalkeepers have this specific award for their position , they are still eligible for the Golden Ball as well , as when Oliver Kahn was awarded in 2002 . In the event of a tie , the Golden Glove Award goes to the goalkeeper who progressed furthest in the competition . The next tiebreakers are saves made , then minutes played . World Cup Golden Glove 1994 United States Michel Preud'homme 1998 France Fabien Barthez 2002 Korea / Japan Oliver Kahn 2006 Germany Gianluigi Buffon 2010 South Africa Iker Casillas 2014 Brazil Manuel Neuer 2018 Russia Thibaut Courtois Although the Golden Glove Award was first awarded in 1994 , every All - Star Team in World Cups prior to 1998 except 1990 included only one goalkeeper .

The award is given to the best player in the tournament who is at most 21 years old . For the 2018 World Cup , this meant that the player had to have been born on or after 1 January 1997 . The election took place on FIFA 's official World Cup website with the help of The FIFA Technical Study Group . FIFA organised a survey on the Internet for users to choose the `` best young player '' of the World Cup , between 1958 and 2002 , named the best young player of each tournament . With 61 % of the overall vote , the winner was Pelé , who finished ahead of the Peruvian Teófilo Cubillas , the best young player at Mexico 1970 , and England 's Michael Owen , who reached similar heights at France 98 .

The winners of this award earn the FIFA Fair Play Trophy , a diploma , a fair play medal for each player and official , and $50,000 worth of football equipment to be used for youth development . The appearance of the award was originally a certificate . From 1982 to 1990 , it had been a golden trophy based on Sport Billy , a football - playing cartoon character from 1982 who became an icon for FIFA Fair play . Ever since 1994 , it is simply a trophy with an elegant footballer figure . Peru was the first nation to win the award after receiving no yellow or red cards in the 1970 FIFA World Cup held in Mexico . Peru 's FIFA Fair Play trophy award .

The ways in which the FIFA All - Star team members have been chosen has varied from year to year . A technical study group consisting of journalists - mostly from Europe and South America - and experts has historically chosen the team . However , in 1994 FIFA decided to add an official squad , chosen by the FIFA technical group and under the brand name MasterCard All - Star Team .

            "FIFA World Cup awards - wikipedia FIFA World Cup awards This is the latest accepted revision , reviewed on 29 October 2018 . This article is about the men 's senior tournament . For the women 's tournament , see FIFA Women 's World Cup awards . At the end of each FIFA World Cup final tournament , several awards are presented to the players and teams which have distinguished themselves in various aspects of the game . Contents 1 Awards 2 Golden Ball 3 Golden Boot 4 Golden Glove 5 Best Young Player Award 6 FIFA Fair Play Trophy 7 Man of the Match 8 Most Entertaining Team 9 All - Star Team 10 Goal of the Tournament 11 References 12 External links Awards ( edit ) There are currently five post-tournament awards , and one given during the tournament : the Golden Ball ( currently commercially termed `` adidas Golden Ball '' ) for best player , first awarded in 1982 ; the Golden Boot ( currently commercially termed `` adidas Golden Boot '' , previously known as the `` adidas Golden Shoe '' from 1982 to 2006 ) for top goal scorer , first awarded in 1982 ; the Golden Glove Award ( currently commercially termed `` adidas Golden Glove '' ; previously known as the `` Lev Yashin Award '' from 1994 to 2006 ) for best goalkeeper , first awarded in 1994 ; the Best Young Player ( currently commercially termed as `` Hyundai Best Young Player '' ) award for best player under 21 years of age at the start of the calendar year , first awarded in 2006 ; the FIFA Fair Play Trophy for the team that advanced to the second round with the best record of fair play , first awarded in 1970 ; the Man of the Match Award ( currently commercially termed as `` Budweiser Man of the Match '' ) for outstanding performance during each game of the tournament , first awarded in 2002 . Two other awards were given between 1994 and 2006 : The Most Entertaining Team award for the team that has entertained the public the most , during the World Cup final tournament , as determined by a poll of the general public ; An All - Star Team comprising the best players of the tournament chosen by the technical study group . Golden Ball ( edit ) The Golden Ball award is presented to the best player at each FIFA World Cup finals , with a shortlist drawn up by the FIFA technical committee and the winner voted for by representatives of the media . Those who finish as runners - up in the vote receive the Silver Ball and Bronze Ball awards as the second and third most outstanding players in the tournament respectively . The current award was introduced in the 1982 FIFA World Cup , sponsored by Adidas and France Football , though fifa.com also lists in their player articles as `` golden ball winners '' Kempes , Cruyff , Pelé , Bobby Charlton , Garrincha and Didi for 1978 , 1974 , 1970 , 1966 , 1962 and 1958 respectively . Barcelona is the only club whose players have won the Golden Ball a record 3 times ( Johan Cruyff in 1974 , Romário in 1994 , Lionel Messi in 2014 ) . Golden Ball World Cup Golden Ball Silver Ball Bronze Ball 1930 Uruguay José Nasazzi Guillermo Stábile José Leandro Andrade 1934 Italy Giuseppe Meazza Matthias Sindelar Oldřich Nejedlý 1938 France Leônidas Silvio Piola György Sárosi 1950 Brazil Zizinho Juan Alberto Schiaffino Ademir 1954 Switzerland Ferenc Puskás Sándor Kocsis Fritz Walter 1958 Sweden Didi Pelé Just Fontaine 1962 Chile Garrincha Josef Masopust Leonel Sánchez 1966 England Bobby Charlton Bobby Moore Eusébio 1970 Mexico Pelé Gérson Gerd Müller 1974 West Germany Johan Cruyff Franz Beckenbauer Kazimierz Deyna 1978 Argentina Mario Kempes Paolo Rossi Dirceu 1982 Spain Paolo Rossi Falcão Karl - Heinz Rummenigge 1986 Mexico Diego Maradona Harald Schumacher Preben Elkjær Larsen 1990 Italy Salvatore Schillaci Lothar Matthäus Diego Maradona 1994 United States Romario Roberto Baggio Hristo Stoichkov 1998 France Ronaldo Davor Šuker Lilian Thuram 2002 Korea / Japan Oliver Kahn Ronaldo Hong Myung - bo 2006 Germany Zinedine Zidane Fabio Cannavaro Andrea Pirlo 2010 South Africa Diego Forlán Wesley Sneijder David Villa 2014 Brazil Lionel Messi Thomas Müller Arjen Robben 2018 Russia Luka Modrić Eden Hazard Antoine Griezmann Golden Boot ( edit ) The Golden Boot or Golden Shoe Award goes to the top goalscorer of the FIFA World Cup . While every World Cup had a ranking of the goalscorers , the first time an award was given was in 1982 , under the name Golden Shoe . It was rechristened Golden Boot in 2010 . FIFA sometimes lists the top goalscorers of previous Cups among the Golden Boot winners . If there is more than one player with the same number of goals , since 1994 the tie - breaker goes to the player without a penalty goal , if none has a penalty then the tie breaker goes to the person with more assists - with the FIFA Technical Study Group deciding whether an assist is to be counted as such . If there is still more than one player , the tie - breaker since 2006 goes to the player who has played the least amount of time , which translates to a higher goal average .

However , FIFA changed it to five goals in November 2006 , making Nejedlý the outright top scorer . Jump up ^ FIFA initially credited Leônidas with eight goals . However , in November 2006 , FIFA confirmed that in the quarter - final tie against Czechoslovakia , he had scored once , not twice as FIFA had originally recorded , meaning he had scored only seven goals in total . Jump up ^ There was controversy regarding the number of goals Brazilian Ademir had scored in 1950 , as a result of incomplete data concerning the Final Round game Brazil vs. Spain ( 6 -- 1 ) . The 5 -- 0 goal had been credited to Jair , but is now credited to Ademir . Jump up ^ Salenko is the only player to win the award playing for a team that were eliminated in the group stages . His six goals are the only international goals he ever scored . Jump up ^ Despite the assist tiebreaker , Salenko and Stoichkov remained tied with 6 goals and one assist each , and both received the Golden Shoe . Jump up ^ Romário and Andersson surpassed the other two players with five goals ( Jürgen Klinsmann and Roberto Baggio ) by having three assists each . Jump up ^ Both runners - up had the same number of assists , and each received the Silver Shoe . Jump up ^ During the tournament , after the group stage match against Costa Rica , Ronaldo logged a protest against the crediting of a goal as an own goal , and FIFA granted him the change . ^ Jump up to : Eight players had scored three goals . Ronaldo , Crespo and Zinedine Zidane stood out for having one assist , and then the two recipients were determined by less playtime ( 308 minutes for Crespo , 411 for Ronaldo , 559 for Zidane ) . ^ Jump up to : Müller , Villa , Sneijder and Diego Forlán tied with five goals . Müller won by virtue of having more assists ( 3 ) than the rest ( each had one ) . Villa won the Silver Boot due to playing fewer minutes than Sneijder , and Sneijder won the Bronze Boot due to having played fewer minutes than Forlán . Jump up ^ Neymar , Lionel Messi and Robin van Persie all had four goals in the tournament . Neymar received the Bronze Boot for playing fewer minutes than his competitors ( 480 ; Messi played 693 minutes , and Van Persie , 548 ) . ^ Jump up to : Griezmann , Lukaku , Denis Cheryshev , Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappé tied with 4 goals . Griezmann won the Silver Boot by virtue of having more assists ( 2 ) than the rest ( Lukaku had one , the rest had zero ) . Lukaku won the Bronze Boot due to having more assists ( one ) than Cheryshev , Ronaldo or Mbappé ( zero ) . Golden Glove ( edit ) The Golden Glove Award is awarded to the best goalkeeper of the tournament . The award was introduced with the name Lev Yashin Award in 1994 , in honor of the late Soviet goalkeeper . The FIFA Technical Study Group recognises the top goalkeeper of the tournament based on the player 's performance throughout the final competition . Although goalkeepers have this specific award for their position , they are still eligible for the Golden Ball as well , as when Oliver Kahn was awarded in 2002 . In the event of a tie , the Golden Glove Award goes to the goalkeeper who progressed furthest in the competition . The next tiebreakers are saves made , then minutes played . World Cup Golden Glove 1994 United States Michel Preud'homme 1998 France Fabien Barthez 2002 Korea / Japan Oliver Kahn 2006 Germany Gianluigi Buffon 2010 South Africa Iker Casillas 2014 Brazil Manuel Neuer 2018 Russia Thibaut Courtois Although the Golden Glove Award was first awarded in 1994 , every All - Star Team in World Cups prior to 1998 except 1990 included only one goalkeeper .

The award is given to the best player in the tournament who is at most 21 years old . For the 2018 World Cup , this meant that the player had to have been born on or after 1 January 1997 . The election took place on FIFA 's official World Cup website with the help of The FIFA Technical Study Group . FIFA organised a survey on the Internet for users to choose the `` best young player '' of the World Cup , between 1958 and 2002 , named the best young player of each tournament . With 61 % of the overall vote , the winner was Pelé , who finished ahead of the Peruvian Teófilo Cubillas , the best young player at Mexico 1970 , and England 's Michael Owen , who reached similar heights at France 98 .

Only teams that qualified for the second round are considered . The winners of this award earn the FIFA Fair Play Trophy , a diploma , a fair play medal for each player and official , and $50,000 worth of football equipment to be used for youth development . The appearance of the award was originally a certificate . From 1982 to 1990 , it had been a golden trophy based on Sport Billy , a football - playing cartoon character from 1982 who became an icon for FIFA Fair play . Ever since 1994 , it is simply a trophy with an elegant footballer figure . Peru was the first nation to win the award after receiving no yellow or red cards in the 1970 FIFA World Cup held in Mexico . Peru 's FIFA Fair Play trophy award .

The ways in which the FIFA All - Star team members have been chosen has varied from year to year . A technical study group consisting of journalists - mostly from Europe and South America - and experts has historically chosen the team . However , in 1994 FIFA decided to add an official squad , chosen by the FIFA technical group and under the brand name MasterCard All - Star Team . For 1998 , 2002 and 2006 , substitute and reserve members were also nominated for full 22 and 23 - player squads . The All - Star team wound up dropped prior to the 2010 tournament - coincidentally , three years after FIFA changed its sponsorship from MasterCard to Visa .

            "FIFA World Cup awards - wikipedia FIFA World Cup awards This is the latest accepted revision , reviewed on 27 July 2018 . This article is about the men 's senior tournament . For the women 's tournament , see FIFA Women 's World Cup awards . At the end of each FIFA World Cup final tournament , several awards are presented to the players and teams which have distinguished themselves in various aspects of the game . Contents 1 Awards 2 Golden Ball 3 Golden Boot 4 Golden Glove 5 Best Young Player Award 6 FIFA Fair Play Trophy 7 Man of the Match 8 Most Entertaining Team 9 All - Star Team 10 Goal of the Tournament 11 References 12 External links Awards There are currently five post-tournament awards , and one given during the tournament : the Golden Ball ( currently commercially termed `` adidas Golden Ball '' ) for best player , first awarded in 1982 ; the Golden Boot ( currently commercially termed `` adidas Golden Boot '' , previously known as the `` adidas Golden Shoe '' from 1982 to 2006 ) for top goal scorer , first awarded in 1982 ; the Golden Glove Award ( currently commercially termed `` adidas Golden Glove '' ; previously known as the `` Lev Yashin Award '' from 1994 to 2006 ) for best goalkeeper , first awarded in 1994 ; the Best Young Player ( currently commercially termed as `` Hyundai Best Young Player '' ) award for best player under 21 years of age at the start of the calendar year , first awarded in 2006 ; the FIFA Fair Play Trophy for the team that advanced to the second round with the best record of fair play , first awarded in 1970 ; the Man of the Match Award ( currently commercially termed as `` Budweiser Man of the Match '' ) for outstanding performance during each game of the tournament , first awarded in 2002 . Two other awards were given between 1994 and 2006 : The Most Entertaining Team award for the team that has entertained the public the most , during the World Cup final tournament , as determined by a poll of the general public ; An All - Star Team comprising the best players of the tournament chosen by the technical study group . Golden Ball The Golden Ball award is presented to the best player at each FIFA World Cup finals , with a shortlist drawn up by the FIFA technical committee and the winner voted for by representatives of the media . Those who finish as runners - up in the vote receive the Silver Ball and Bronze Ball awards as the second and third most outstanding players in the tournament respectively . The current award was introduced in the 1982 FIFA World Cup , sponsored by Adidas and France Football , though fifa.com also lists in their player articles as `` golden ball winners '' Kempes , Cruyff , Pelé , Bobby Charlton , Garrincha and Didi for 1978 , 1974 , 1970 , 1966 , 1962 and 1958 respectively . Barcelona is the only club whose players have won the Golden Ball a record 3 times ( Johan Cruyff in 1974 , Romário in 1994 , Lionel Messi in 2014 ) . Golden Ball World Cup Golden Ball Silver Ball Bronze Ball 1930 Uruguay José Nasazzi Guillermo Stábile José Leandro Andrade 1934 Italy Giuseppe Meazza Matthias Sindelar Oldřich Nejedlý 1938 France Leônidas Silvio Piola György Sárosi 1950 Brazil Zizinho Juan Alberto Schiaffino Ademir 1954 Switzerland Ferenc Puskás Sándor Kocsis Fritz Walter 1958 Sweden Didi Pelé Just Fontaine 1962 Chile Garrincha Josef Masopust Leonel Sánchez 1966 England Bobby Charlton Bobby Moore Eusébio 1970 Mexico Pelé Gérson Gerd Müller 1974 West Germany Johan Cruyff Franz Beckenbauer Kazimierz Deyna 1978 Argentina Mario Kempes Paolo Rossi Dirceu 1982 Spain Paolo Rossi Falcão Karl - Heinz Rummenigge 1986 Mexico Diego Maradona Harald Schumacher Preben Elkjær Larsen 1990 Italy Salvatore Schillaci Lothar Matthäus Diego Maradona 1994 United States Romario Roberto Baggio Hristo Stoichkov 1998 France Ronaldo Davor Šuker Lilian Thuram 2002 Korea / Japan Oliver Kahn Ronaldo Hong Myung - bo 2006 Germany Zinedine Zidane Fabio Cannavaro Andrea Pirlo 2010 South Africa Diego Forlán Wesley Sneijder David Villa 2014 Brazil Lionel Messi Thomas Müller Arjen Robben 2018 Russia Luka Modrić Eden Hazard Antoine Griezmann Golden Boot The Golden Boot or Golden Shoe Award goes to the top goalscorer of the FIFA World Cup . While every World Cup had a ranking of the goalscorers , the first time an award was given was in 1982 , under the name Golden Shoe . It was rechristened Golden Boot in 2010 . FIFA sometimes lists the top goalscorers of previous Cups among the Golden Boot winners . If there is more than one player with the same number of goals , since 1994 the tie - breaker goes to the player without a penalty goal , if none has a penalty then the tie breaker goes to the person with more assists - with the FIFA Technical Study Group deciding whether an assist is to be counted as such . If there is still more than one player , the tie - breaker since 2006 goes to the player who has played the least amount of time , which translates to a higher goal average .

However , FIFA changed it to five goals in November 2006 , making Nejedlý the outright top scorer . Jump up ^ FIFA initially credited Leônidas with eight goals . However , in November 2006 , FIFA confirmed that in the quarter - final tie against Czechoslovakia , he had scored once , not twice as FIFA had originally recorded , meaning he had scored only seven goals in total . Jump up ^ There was controversy regarding the number of goals Brazilian Ademir had scored in 1950 , as a result of incomplete data concerning the Final Round game Brazil vs. Spain ( 6 -- 1 ) . The 5 -- 0 goal had been credited to Jair , but is now credited to Ademir . Jump up ^ Salenko is the only player to win the award playing for a team that were eliminated in the group stages . His six goals are the only international goals he ever scored . Jump up ^ Despite the assist tiebreaker , Salenko and Stoichkov remained tied with 6 goals and one assist each , and both received the Golden Shoe . Jump up ^ Romário and Andersson surpassed the other two players with five goals ( Jürgen Klinsmann and Roberto Baggio ) by having three assists each . Jump up ^ Both runners - up had the same number of assists , and each received the Silver Shoe . Jump up ^ During the tournament , after the group stage match against Costa Rica , Ronaldo logged a protest against the crediting of a goal as an own goal , and FIFA granted him the change . ^ Jump up to : Eight players had scored three goals . Ronaldo , Crespo and Zinedine Zidane stood out for having one assist , and then the two recipients were determined by less playtime ( 308 minutes for Crespo , 411 for Ronaldo , 559 for Zidane ) . ^ Jump up to : Müller , Villa , Sneijder and Diego Forlán tied with five goals . Müller won by virtue of having more assists ( 3 ) than the rest ( each had one ) . Villa won the Silver Boot due to playing fewer minutes than Sneijder , and Sneijder won the Bronze Boot due to having played fewer minutes than Forlán . Jump up ^ Neymar , Lionel Messi and Robin van Persie all had four goals in the tournament . Neymar received the Bronze Boot for playing fewer minutes than his competitors ( 480 ; Messi played 693 minutes , and Van Persie , 548 ) . ^ Jump up to : Griezmann , Lukaku , Denis Cheryshev , Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappé tied with 4 goals . Griezmann won the Silver Boot by virtue of having more assists ( 2 ) than the rest ( Lukaku had one , the rest had zero ) . Lukaku won the Bronze Boot due to having more assists ( one ) than Cheryshev , Ronaldo or Mbappé ( zero ) . Golden Glove The Golden Glove Award is awarded to the best goalkeeper of the tournament . The award was introduced with the name Lev Yashin Award in 1994 , in honor of the late Soviet goalkeeper . The FIFA Technical Study Group recognises the top goalkeeper of the tournament based on the player 's performance throughout the final competition . Although goalkeepers have this specific award for their position , they are still eligible for the Golden Ball as well , as when Oliver Kahn was awarded in 2002 . Although the Golden Glove Award was first awarded in 1994 , every All - Star Team in World Cups prior to 1998 except 1990 included only one goalkeeper . In the event of a tie , the Golden Glove Award goes to the goalkeeper who progressed furthest in the competition . The next tiebreakers are saves made , then minutes played .

FIFA organised a survey on the Internet for users to choose the `` best young player '' of the World Cup , between 1958 and 2002 , named the best young player of each tournament . With 61 % of the overall vote , the winner was Pelé , who finished ahead of the Peruvian Teófilo Cubillas , the best young player at Mexico 1970 , and England 's Michael Owen , who reached similar heights at France 98 .

From 1982 to 1990 , it had been a golden trophy based on Sport Billy , a football - playing cartoon character from 1982 who became an icon for FIFA Fair play . Ever since 1994 , it is simply a trophy with an elegant footballer figure . Peru was the first nation to win the award after receiving no yellow or red cards in the 1970 FIFA World Cup held in Mexico . Peru 's FIFA Fair Play trophy award .

The ways in which the FIFA All - Star team members have been chosen has varied from year to year . A technical study group consisting of journalists - mostly from Europe and South America - and experts has historically chosen the team . However , in 1994 FIFA decided to add an official squad , chosen by the FIFA technical group and under the brand name MasterCard All - Star Team . For 1998 , 2002 and 2006 , substitute and reserve members were also nominated for full 22 and 23 - player squads . The All - Star team wound up dropped prior to the 2010 tournament - coincidentally , three years after FIFA changed its sponsorship from MasterCard to Visa .
